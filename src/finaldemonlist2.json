      "description": "<p>Gnostic name for the demigog who rules the 365th (highest and final) aeon, or sphere, ascending to the unknowable God. Christian demonologists put <b>Abraxas</b> in the ranks for demons.</p><p> <b>Abraxas</b> also was the name of a sun mounting an ouroborus (a snake biting its tail) held by the highest Egyptian goddess, Isis, the creator of the Sun and mistress of all the gods. Isis mythology found its way into Gnosticism. In addition, <b>Abraxas</b> was associated with the Mithraic mystery religion of Persian origin, the chief rival of Christianity in Rome in its first 400 years. As did Gnosticism, Mithraism featured a complex astrology and numerology. Numerical values of Mithra’s and <b>Abraxas'</b> names each total 365.</p><p> The Gnostic <b>Abraxas</b> created the material world and also had demonic qualities. He is the supreme power of being, in whom light and darkness are both united and transcended. Orthodox Christians viewed <b>Abraxas</b> as a demon. In turn, <b>Abraxas</b> became a favorite deity of heretical sects of the Middle Ages.</p><p> Gnostic talismans made of carved opal show <b>Abraxas</b> as a figure with a human body, the head of a rooster (or occasionally a hawk), and SERPENT legs. His hands hold a shield and a whip, the shield usually inscribed with the name Iao, reminiscent of the Jewish four-letter name of God. He is often mounted on a chariot drawn by four white horses, with both Sun and Moon overhead.</p><p> The rooster represents wakefulness and is related to the human heart and the universal heart, the Sun. The human torso embodies the principle of logos, or articulated thought. The snake legs indicate prudence. The shield is symbolic of wisdom, the great protector of divine warriors. The whip denotes the relentless driving power of life. The four horses symbolize the four ethers by which solar power is circulated throughout the universe.</p><p> The seven letters of the name of <b>Abraxas</b> represent the seven creative powers and planetary spheres, or angels, recognized in the ancient world. The letters add up to a numerological value of 365, the number of days and powers of the year.</p><p> Carl G. Jung called <b>Abraxas</b> the <i>Truly Terrible One</i> because of his ability to generate truth and falsehood, good and evil, light and darkness with the same word and in the same deed. In Jungian psychology there is no easy way out of psychic confl ict; one must not only fight on the side of the angels but occasionally join the host of the Fallen angels. According to Jung, fear of <b>Abraxas</b> is the beginning of wisdom, and liberation, or gnosis, is achieved by not resisting.</p>",

As such, he is not immortal, and eventually his reign of terror will be conquered by the forces of good.</p><p> There are different legends about the origins of <b>Ahriman</b> as the evil god. In one, Ahura Mazda, the good god, created the universe and twins called Spenta Mainyu (the spirit of Light, Truth, and Life) and Angra Mainyu (the spirit of Darkness, Deceit and Death). The twins fight for supremacy and their battleground is Earth. Over time, Spenta Mainyu became absorbed into Ahura Mazda, and Angra Mainyu became <b>Ahriman</b>.</p><p> The battle between the two forces continues and will last for thousands of years, divided into eras. After the fourth era, three saviors will appear, who will destroy <b>Ahriman</b> and all his forces of evil.</p><p> In a variation of this legend Ahura Mazda created Angra Mainyu in a moment of doubt when he was making the universe.</p><p> According to another legend, <b>Ahriman</b> and Ormazd (a contraction of <i>Ahura Mazda</i>) were twins born to Zuvan, the creator deity. Zurvan declared that the firstborn would be supreme ruler. <b>Ahriman</b> ripped himself out of the womb in order to be first. Zurvan was bound by his promise, but he limited the time that <b>Ahriman</b> could rule. At the end of that, Ormazd would take over and reign in goodness and light. The Earth is presently under the rule of <b>Ahriman</b>; that is why there are drought, famine, war, disease, pestilence, and other ills. To aid him in his rule, <b>Ahriman</b> created 99,999 diseases, and six archdemons, called Evil Mind, Tyranny, Enmity, Violence, Wrath, and Falsehood. He also created a female demon named AZ and a dragon. The archdemons struggle against the six archangel <i>amarahspands</i>, or <i>Bounteous Immortals</i>.</p><p> <b>Ahriman</b> tried to maim the prophet Zarathustra but failed.</p><p> A legend about <b>Ahriman</b> says that he had a son named Zohak, whom he trained to be evil. He told Zohak to kill his own father. He disguised himself, however, and Zohak killed someone he thought was his father. <b>Ahriman</b>, again in disguise, became chef of the palace. Zohak was so impressed with him that he offered to reward him. <b>Ahriman</b> asked only to kiss his shoulders. When he did so, serpents sprang from the spots. Every time Zohak cut them off, they grew back. <b>Ahriman</b> entered in another disguise, as a doctor, and told Zohak that he had to feed the serpents human brains every day. Zohak complied and became <b>Ahriman's</b> pride. The son ruled for a thousand years and finally was destroyed.</p><p> Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, said Ahrimanic forces are intelligent, clever spirits that seek to keep people mired in materialism.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The demon of lust, the third of the Seven Deadly Sins, and of jealousy, anger, and revenge, and the 32nd of the 72 Spirtis of Solomon.</p><p> <b>Asmodeus'</b> chief objectives are to prevent intercourse between husband and wife, wreck new marriages, and force husbands to commit adultery. He is also one of the chief demons involved in cases of possession  Throughout history, he has been regarded as one of the most evil of Satan’s infernal demons. He is usually portrayed as having three heads, those of an ogre, a ram, and a bull, all sexually licentious creatures; having the feet of a cock, another sexually aggressive creature; and having wings and the tail of a serpent. He rides on a dragon and breathes fire.</p><p> <b>Asmodeus</b> has his roots in ancient Persia. His name is derived from Aeshma, one of the seven archangels, or <i>amarahspands</i>, of Persian mythology. The Hebrews absorbed him into their mythology, where he attained the highest status and most power of all his legends. According to the Hebrews, he is the son of Naamah and Shamdon. Prior to his fall from heaven, he was part of the seraphim, the highest order of angels. In other Hebrew legends, he is either associated with or the husband of Lilith, the demon queen of lust. Sometimes he is said to be the offspring of Lilith and Adam.</p><p> The book of Tobit tells how <b>Asmodeus</b> lusted after a young woman named Sarah and killed each of her seven husbands before the marriages could be consummated. With an eighth suitor, Tobias, in her life, Sarah prayed to God for help. God sent down the archangel Raphael, who instructed Tobias in how to make an incense of the heart and liver of a glanos fish, which would drive away <b>Asmodeus</b>. After Tobias and Sarah were married, <b>Asmodeus</b>Asmodeus appeared in their wedding chamber to kill Tobias, but the incense forced him to flee. He went to Egypt, but Raphael tracked him down and bound him.</p><p> According to the pseudepigraphical Testament of Solomon, <b>Asmodeus</b> lives in the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). He spreads the wickedness of men, plots against newlyweds, spreads madness about women through the stars, ruins the beauty of virgins, and commits murders. He is forever thwarted by Raphael and the smoking liver and gall of a fish, especially the sheatfish, which lives in Assyrian rivers. He has knowledge of the future.</p><p> <b>Asmodeus</b> is taken into the presence of King Solomon by the Prince of demons, Beelzebub. Sullen, arrogant, and defiant, he tells the king he was born of a human mother and an angel father. He also says that Solomon will have only a temporary hold over the demons; his kingdom eventually will be divided, and demons will go out again among men and will be worshipped as gods because humans will not know the names of the angels who thwart the demons. He admits that he is afraid of water.</p><p> Solomon binds <b>Asmodeus</b> with care. He orders the demon to be flogged and orders him to state his activities. <b>Asmodeus</b> says, “I am the renowned Asmodeus; I cause the wickedness of men to spread throughout the world. I am always hatching plots against newlyweds; I mar the beauty of virgins and cause their hearts to grow cold...I spread madness about women through the stars and I have often committed a rash of murders.”</p><p> Solomon puts him in iron chains and surrounds him with 10 jars full of water, which make the demon complain bitterly. <b>Asmodeus</b> is forced to make clay vessels for the temple. Solomon also burns the liver and gall of a fish and a branch of storax beneath the demon, quelling his nasty tongue. </p><p>Solomon uses his magic ring to force <b>Asmodeus</b> and other demons to build his magnifi cent temple. After its completion, Solomon tells <b>Asmodeus</b> that he cannot understand why demons are so powerful when he, their leader, could be so easily chained. <b>Asmodeus</b> says he will prove his greatness if Solomon will remove his chains and lend him the magical ring. Solomon does so, only to be hurled far away from Jerusalem. <b>Asmodeus</b> steals the ring, forces Solomon into exile, and becomes king himself. He throws the ring into the sea. But Solomon’s lover, the Ammonite Namah, finds the ring in a fish belly, and the king regains his power. He is immediately transported to Jerusalem when he puts on the ring. As punishment, he puts <b>Asmodeus</b> in a jar.</p><p> <b>Asmodeus</b> was absorbed into Christian lore, becoming one of the Devil’s leading agents of provocation. Witches were said to worship him, and magicians and sorcerers attempted to conjure him to strike out at enemies. Grimoires of magical instruction sternly admonish anyone seeking an audience with <b>Asmodeus</b> to summon him bareheaded out of respect. Johann Weyer said <b>Asmodeus</b> rules gambling houses.</p><p> According to the <i>Lemegton</i>, a major Grimoire, <b>Asmodeus</b> is the “first and chiefest” under Amaynon and goes before all other demons. He gives the ring of virtues and teaches arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all handicrafts. When properly summoned, he gives full and true answers to all questions. He can make a person invisible and will reveal all treasures under the guard of Amaynon. </p><p>He was one of the infernal agents blamed for the obscene sexual possession of the Louviers nuns in 17th century France.</p>",

The incident is recounted in Matthew (12:24–29), Mark (3:22–27), and Luke (11:14–22):</p><p> <p class=\"indent\">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, he hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of Devils casteth he out Devils. And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. (Mark 3: 22–27)</p></p><p> In the pseudepigraphical text the Testament of Solomon, <b>Beelzebub</b>, or Beelzeboul, is the Prince of demons and is controlled by King Solomon with the help of his magical ring. Solomon has the demon Ornias fetch <b>Beelzebub</b> to him; <b>Beelzebub</b> resists but succumbs to the power of the ring.</p><p> <b>Beelzebub</b> identifies himself as \"the ruler of all demons.\" Solomon orders <b>Beelzebub</b> to explain the manifestation of demons, and he promises to give to the king all unclean spirits bound. He tells Solomon that he lives in the Evening Star (Venus). He alone is the Prince of demons because he was the highest-ranking angel in heaven and is the only one left of the heavenly angels who fell. He was accompanied by another Fallen angel, Abezethibou, who was cast into the Red Sea. Abezethibou will return in triumph when he is ready, <b>Beelzebub</b> says.</p><p> Solomon orders him to summon Abezethibou, but <b>Beelzebub</b> refuses to present any demon. However, he says, a demon named Ephippas will appear and raise Abezethibou out of the sea.</p><p> <b>Beelzebub</b> says he destroys tyrants, causes men to worship demons, and arouses sexual desire in holy men and \"select priests.\" He also causes wars, instigates murders, and arouses jealousy. He is thwarted by “the Almighty God,” Emmanuel (Jesus), and will disappear if anyone uses the oath <i>Elo-i</i> (my God, which Jesus cried on the cross).</p><p> Solomon tells <b>Beelzebub</b> to cut blocks of Theban marble for the building of his temple. The other demons protest at this unfi tting task for so mighty a demon. Solomon tells <b>Beelzebub</b> that if he wishes his freedom, he will tell the king about other \"heavenly things.\" <b>Beelzebub</b> says that Solomon can strengthen his house by burning oil of myrrh, frankincense, sea bulbs, spikenard, and saffron and lighting seven lamps during an earthquake. Lighting the seven lamps at dawn will reveal the heavenly dragons pulling the chariot of the Sun. Solomon does not believe him and orders the demon to continue cutting marble and producing other demons for interrogation.</p><p> The apochryphal text <i>Gospel of Nicodemus</i> describes how <b>Beelzebub</b> came to rule in Hell over Satan. After the crucifixion of Jesus, Satan bragged to <b>Beelzebub</b> that he was going to take Jesus to hell in revenge for all the times he had thwarted Satan. <b>Beelzebub</b> begged him not to do so, for Jesus was too powerful and would upset Hell.</p><p> Jesus arrived, and <b>Beelzebub</b> pushed Satan from the mouth of hell and barricaded the gate, calling upon all the demons to help him. They could not keep Jesus out. Jesus trampled over Satan and snapped the chains of the imprisoned souls with a single word. He released all the trapped saints, who went immediately to heaven. <b>Beelzebub</b> was powerless against him.</p><p> As he left, Satan told <b>Beelzebub</b>, \"Satan the Prince shall be subject to thy dominion forever, in the place of Adam and his righteous sons, who are Mine.\"</p><p> In medieval times <b>Beelzebub</b> was regarded as a demon of great power. He was said to reign over witches' Sabbats. Witches denied Christ in his name and chanted it as they danced: \"Beelzebub goity,Beelzebub beyty Beelzebub above, Beelzebub below.\" Their Eucharist was bread with <i>Beelzebub</i> imprinted on it instead of <i>Jesus</i>.</p><p> There are many stories of his copulating with witches in wild orgies. The witches were said to gather around the altar in a semicircle and then lie flat on the ground. They swallowed a foul medicine that made them sweat and then froze them in place. While they were unable to move, Beelzebub copulated with them. A frenzied orgy then began.</p><p> When Black Masses were fashionable in high society in the 17th century, <b>Beelzebub's</b> name was chanted during the rites. </p><p>According to magical Grimoires, a sorcerer conjures <b>Beelzebub</b> at his own risk of death by epilepsy, apoplexy, or strangulation. Once conjured, the demon is difficult to banish. A conjuring spell for him is:</p> <p class=\"indent\"><div class=\"triple-grid\"><div>BEELZEBUB</div> <div>LUCIFER</div> <div>MADILON</div> <div>SOLYMO</div> <div>SAROY</div> <div>THEU</div> <div>AMECLO</div> <div>SAGRAEL</div> <div>PRAREDUN</div> <div>VENITE</div> <div>BEELZEBUTH</div> <div>AMEN.</div></div></p><p> <b>Beelzebub</b> also was among the demons blamed for demonic possession cases, among them Nicole Obry in Laon, France, in 1566, and the bewitchment of nuns in the <i>Loudon possession</i>  and <i>Aix-en-Provence possession</i> in France in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, leading to the executions of his accused lieutenants, Fathers Louis Gaufridi and Urbain Grandier. </p><p>One of the demon’s most notorious acts was the <i>Earling possession</i> in the early 20th century in Earling, Iowa. <b>Beelzebub</b> entered young Anna Ecklund at the behest of her father, Jacob, in retaliation for not engaging in incestuous sex with him. The demon left on December 23, 1928, in a terrible roar of “Beelzebub, Judas, Jacob, Mina (Anna's aunt and Jacob's mistress)' followed by 'hell, hell, hell' and terrible stench.</p><p> <b>Beelzebub</b> rules gluttony, the fifth of the Seven Deadly Sins.</p>",

Typhon fathered many of the beasts of Greek legend, including Echidna, a halfwoman, half-serpent. <b>Cerberus</b> lives in a den on one side of the river Styx that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. There, he greets the shades of the newly dead as they are ferried across the river by Charon. <b>Cerberus</b> is unpredictable in his friendliness or hostility; therefore, the dead are buried with honey cake offerings for the shades to give him, which guarantee his friendliness.</p><p> As gatekeeper to the underworld, <b>Cerberus</b> also prevents shades from escaping.

      "name": "Choronzon (Coronzon)",
      "description": "<p>Demon or spirit identified in the 16th century by John Dee and Edward Kelly, summoned in a dramatic ritual by Aleister Crowley in 1909. Dee referred to \"Coronzon,\" or 333, in his Enochian communications with spirits; he did not consider it to be a demon. Crowley called <b>Choronzon</b> the <i>demon of Dispersions</i> and <i>of the Abyss</i>.</p><p> The account of Crowley’s evocation is full of drama; it is not known whether the events happened as objective experiences or were experienced as visions. Crowley claimed to have conquered <b>Choronzon</b> to become a full Master of the Temple and Secret Chief.</p><p> The evocation was performed in 1909. In November, Crowley and Neuberg went to Algiers on holiday and walked south through the desert to Aumale. There, Crowley was summoned by the voice of Aiwass, the entity who had dictated to him <i>The Book of the Law</i>, to \"call Me.\" He had with him the Enochian Keys of Dee and Kelly used to communicate with angels and spirits and felt he had received a divine message to use them. Crowley had successfully used the 19th Key or Call, the most difficult, to access two of the 30 aethyrs or aires (levels or planes) of expanded consciousness. He decided to access the remaining 28 aethyrs. Crowley and Neuberg went out into the desert to a mount and ascended it. To make the Call, Crowley held a vermilion-painted Calvary Cross with an engraved topaz set in its axis. The topaz was engraved with a rose of 49 petals. When his clairvoyant visions unfolded, Crowley dictated to Neuberg. They performed one aethyr a day, except for one day when they two performed. They started with the last-numbered aethyr and worked backward toward the first. Most of Crowley’s visions were apocalyptic in nature. In the 15th aethyr, he underwent an initiation to the magical grade of Master of the Temple, a title that could be fully realized only by accessing the other aethyrs. However, Crowley experienced great difficulty in trying to access the next, the 14th aethyr. After making several attempts, he stopped. He and Neuberg were on their way down the mount when Crowley suddenly was seized with the inspiration to perform a homosexual magic ritual with Neuberg and dedicate it to the Greek god of nature, Pan. They went  back to the top of the mount, inscribed in the sand a magic circle protected with names and words of power, and made a crude stone altar. Crowley took the submissive role in the sexual act as a way of eliminating ego. The ritual marked a turning point for him in his view of the importance of sex in magic; he now saw it as a beneficial sacrament. The ritual also led to a breakthrough in consciousness, for later that evening, Crowley gained access to the 14th aethyr. In his vision, he was informed that in order to attain his cherished goal of becoming a Secret Chief and Master of the Temple, he had to undergo the complete death of his ego and unite his spirit with the ocean of infinity. Only this way, could he cross the Abyss, the gulf that separates ordinary mortals from the Secret Chiefs.</p><p> Crowley was able to resume his explorations of the other aethyrs, where he received Revelation after Revelation, laden with symbolism. In the 11th aethyr, he was told that in the 10th aethyr he would have to make a conscious crossing of the Abyss, inhabited by a single entity, the demon <b>Choronzon</b>, the <i>first and deadliest of all the powers of evil</i>, a being composed of <i>complete negation</i>.</p><p> The ritual for crossing the Abyss took place on December 6, 1909, outside the town of Bou Saada. Crowley and Neuberg walked out into the desert until they found a valley that had a suitable floor of fine sand. They formed a circle of rocks, drew around it a magic circle, and then drew a magic triangle. The demon would be invoked into the triangle. The circle would protect Neuberg, who would sit within it, armed with a magical knife and a notebook for recording what happened. Crowley intended to enter the triangle, a dangerous act for a magician. He thus became perhaps the first magician in the Western magical tradition to offer his own body ritually as a vehicle for manifestation of a demon.</p><p> Before the start of the ritual, Neuberg took an oath that he would defend the magic circle \"with thoughts and words and deeds\" and would use the knife to attack anything that entered it, even Crowley.</p><p> Crowley apparently was not in the triangle when he invoked the aethyr, but was in a <i>secret place</i> out of the sight and hearing of Neuberg. After the invocation, Crowley entered the triangle. To help the demon materialize, he sacrificed three pigeons at the points of the triangle and sprinkled their blood. He took care not to let a drop fall outside the triangle, for that would enable <b>Choronzon</b> to manifest in the universe. When all the blood had soaked into the sand, he secretly recited the Call of the aethyr. He was in full trance.</p><p> Neuberg records that he heard a voice, simulating Crowley’s voice, call out barbarous names and then blasphemies. Visions appeared within the triangle. First, Neuberg saw the form of a woman prostitute he had known in Paris. The \"woman\" tried to seduce him, but Neuberg resisted, fi guring it was <b>Choronzon</b> in a shape-shifted form. The \"woman\" then offered submission, which he also rejected. The demon next turned into an old man, then a serpent, and then into Crowley, who begged for water. Neuberg held fast within the circle.Neuberg ordered <b>Choronzon</b> to declare his nature. The demon replied that he spat upon the name of the Most High. He was Master of the Triangle, who had no fear of the pentagram. He gave Neuberg words that the magician took as \"great secrets of magic\" but turned out to be worthless, a joke played by the demon. Neuberg invoked Aiwass. <b>Choronzon</b> said that he knew the name of the angel and that \"all thy dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries\".</p><p> Ordered again to declare his true nature, <b>Choronzon</b> said his name was <i>Dispersion</i> and he could not be bested in argument. He uttered a rapid string of blasphemies that taxed Neuberg’s ability to record. While distracting the magician with blasphemies, <b>Choronzon</b> threw sand onto the magic circle. When the outline was sufficiently blurred, he took the form of a naked man and leaped into it, throwing Neuberg to the ground. The two fought furiously. The demon tried to tear out Neuberg’s throat with his froth-covered fangs. At last, Neuberg was able to force <b>Choronzon</b> back into the triangle, and he repaired the magic circle.</p><p> Man and demon argued. <b>Choronzon</b> threatened Neuberg with all the tortures of Hell, and Neuberg denounced the demon as a liar. After a long time at this, the demon suddenly vanished, leaving Crowley alone in the circle. Crowley traced the word <i>Babalon</i> in the sand, and the ritual was over. He and Neuberg built a fire for purification and ritually destroyed the circle and triangle.</p><p> Neuberg maintained that he had literally wrestled with <b>Choronzon</b>, and not with Crowley possessed by the demon. Some occultists have posited that Crowley somehow exuded an ectoplasm that enabled the demon to make a form tangible enough to fight with Neuberg. Another explanation advanced is that the entire experience was visionary. Whatever the truth, both Crowley and Neuberg felt that Crowley had beaten the demon and achieved the status of Master of the Temple and Secret Chief. Crowley’s new vision of himself was as teacher and prophet who was to indoctrinate the world with the philosophy of <i>The Book of the Law</i>.</p><p> Associates of Crowley said the ritual permanently damaged him and that he was possessed by <b>Choronzon</b> for the rest of his life.</p>",

      "name": "Devil",
      "description": "<p>The personification of evil. In Christianity, <b>Devil</b> is the proper name for the evil counterpart to God, who rules the torments of Hell and commands armies of demons. The <b>Devil</b> represents darkness, chaos, destruction, suffering, and the complete absence of good, light, and love. The word <i>Devil</i>, spelled in lowercase, also is a generic term used interchangeably with demon to denote a lower-ranking evil entity.</p><p>The term <b>Devil</b> is derived from the Greek <i>diabolos</i> (slanderer or accuser), in turn translated from the Hebrew word <i>Satan</i>. The concept of the <b>Devil</b> as archfiend of evil developed slowly over many centuries, becoming a composite of Lucifer, the Fallen Angel whose pride and ego cause him to be expelled from heaven; Satan, the tempter of humans; and pagan deities such as Pan and Cernunnos.</p><p> In non-Western traditions, evil is expressed through deities, who are seldom completely evil. The gods of a conquered people become Devils or evil; Christianity demonized pagan gods as it spread in dominance.</p><p> <i>Evolution of the Devil</i><br> The Christian <b>Devil</b> evolved from ideas and personifications of evil in Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and classical mythology and in Hebrew demonology. Egyptian gods embody qualities of both good and evil, but the god Set personifies more of the dark side than others. As the evil brother of Osiris, Set represents chaos and destruction. In myth, he slays Osiris, dismembers him, and scatters parts of his body. Osiris’ wife, Isis, reassembles them and reanimates the corpse long enough for a sexual union, which produces the son Horus.</p><p> Mesopotamian demons are the offspring of gods, such as Tiamat, the goddess of chaos and the primordial waters, and her partner, Apsu, as well as the high god Anu.  demons rule diseases, illnesses, nightmares, plagues, and all misfortunes that befall living things. They are grotesque and deformed and often part-human and partanimal. Protections against them are gained through amulets, incantations, and magic.</p><p> In <i>Zoroastrianism</i>, the one God, Ahuru Mazda (who became Ohrmazd), generates the twins Spenta Mainyu, who is holy, and Angra Mainyu (who became Ahriman), who is evil and destructive. The creation story varies according to the streams of <i>Zoroastrianism</i>. In one, Ahuru Mazda and Ahriman are separated by a void. As does the Christian <b>Devil</b>, Ahriman dwells in darkness on the opposite side of the void and is fated to be conquered by good, Ohrmazd.</p><p> Ahriman sees the light of good across the void and lusts for it. He sends his weapons of destruction, which include toads, scorpions, serpents, lust, and chaos, against Ohrmadz. Ohrmadz offers a truce of redemption, but Ahriman refuses it. Orhmadz reveals his fated defeat, which sends Ahriman spinning unconscious into the outer reaches of the void for 3,000 years. He revives with the help of Jeh, a whore, and engages Ohrmazd in battle for 6000 years, foreshadowing the Armageddon of Revelation. In the first 3,000 years, the forces of good and evil are balanced. In the final 3,000 years, good triumphs over evil. In his assault, Ahriman tears apart the sky and creates the hours of night and darkness, and violence and destruction of life. He creates hordes of demons.</p><p> Ahriman corrupts the man and woman who are the ancestors of humanity, Mashye and Mashyane, by tempting them to believe the lie that he, not Ohrmazd, created the material world. Ohrmazd creates forces of good that bind Ahriman, ultimately enabling the world to be repaired. But in the last phase of the battle, the entire cosmos shakes and much destruction is done. Stars fall from the sky. Ohrmadz either destroys Ahriman or imprisons him forever.</p><p> In the Yasht text, Ahriman will be defeated by the coming of a Saoshyant, or Savior. Three saviors will come forward, and the third, a son of Zarathustra conceived by a virgin, will destroy evil and bring forth the reign of righteousness. The world will be restored, the dead will arise, and life and immortality will arrive.</p><p> In classical mythology, the gods and goddesses all have both good and evil characteristics; there is no one personification of evil alone. Shades of the dead live in a dull, shadowy realm, Hades, the lowest level of which is Tartarus, a pit or abyss in which the wicked are tormented. Greek philosophy evolved along the lines of moral good and evil, and the distinguishing of the originally ambivalent daimones into good demons and evil demons.</p><p> The Judaic concept of the <b>Devil</b> developed slowly. The Old Testament tells of different Satans, or accusers, rather than a single Satan. One of these is permitted by God to test the faith of Job. The apocalyptic literature placed the harsh and punishing aspects in certain angels, such as Mastema, the only significant angel mentioned by name in the book of Jubilees. In Enoch, the Watchers are wicked angels whose fall, of their own choice, leads to evil on the earth. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs name Belial, or Satan, as the leader of evil angels. Sammael and Azazel also are named as leaders of wicked angels, who dwell in darkness. The apocalyptic literature developed a more dualistic idea of evil personified in the <b>Devil</b> as the head of a realm of darkness whose primary role is to seduce, accuse, and destroy.</p><p> In Islam, the <b>Devil</b> is not the dualistic counterpart to God, but a high-level being—either an angel or djinn— who chooses to fall from grace rather than bow to God’s first human, Adam. The <b>Devil</b> is most often named Shaytan in the Qur’an, an accursed and rejected rebel who has God’s permission to use temptation to corrupt souls. He has no power over those who love God. God has no power over his demonic servants, the Shaitan. The <b>Devil</b> is part of God’s creation and plan involving punishment and testing. The Qur’an also gives the name of Iblis as the <b>Devil</b>.</p><p> There is no concept of original sin in the Qur’an. Adam and Eve sinned but did not pass on the taint to others. Humans are prone to evil and, therefore, vulnerable to the snares of the <b>Devil</b>. The <b>Devil</b> vows to put all of Adam’s descendants under his sway.</p><p> In the New Testament of Christianity, the <b>Devil</b> becomes more personal and the great antagonist of God as well as humans. He is a Fallen angel, the leader of hordes of Fallen angels-turned-demons, and he is the principle of evil itself. He has power over the physical world. His forces of darkness are pitched in war against God’s forces of light. Jesus, as the Son of God, goes to Earth in order to defeat him. Revelation forecasts that Christ, in his second coming, will bind the <b>Devil</b> for one thousand years, at which time the <b>Devil</b> will reappear one final time, as the Antichrist, before being destroyed. The dualism of Christianity became firmly established, with a god of light and goodness and a god of evil and darkness.</p><p> In 325, the Council of Nicaea confirmed that God was the creator of everything visible and invisible. Therefore, the <b>Devil</b> was originally created good but chose the path of evil.</p><p> It was not until later in Christianity that the <b>Devil</b> was seen as the ruler and inhabitant of hell. These concepts were more firmly cemented in literature, such as authored by Dante and John Milton.</p><p> By the Middle Ages, the <b>Devil</b> was a real, potent being who possessed terrible supernatural powers and was intent upon destroying humans by undermining their morals. In this pursuit, he was aided by an army of evil demons. This army expanded to include heretics and sorcerers, whose magic posed a threat to the divine miracles of the church. Witches were included, first as associates of sorcerers, then as heretics. Preachers in the Renaissance and Reformation pounded fear of the <b>Devil</b> into their followers by constantly inveighing against his attempts to pervert people and turn them away from God. Satan’s kingdom was the material world. He would tempt people with false riches, luxuries, and carnal pleasures, only to claim their souls for eternal damnation in the end. His chief means of attacking others was through demonic possession  pacts with the <b>Devil</b>, which date back to the sixth century, became implied; any consort with the <b>Devil</b> automatically meant one had entered into a diabolic pact. John Stearne, the assistant to Matthew Hopkins, England’s notorious witch finder of the 17th century, was of the opinion that the preachers’ obsession with Satan encouraged witches to worship him. </p></p><i>Appearance of the Devil</i><br> Christianity portrays the true form of the Devil as ugly, reformed, and reptilian: a human torso and limbs with reptilian head, clawed hands and feet, a tail, and scaly snakeskin. He has horns, which signify power and association with the dark forces—night, chaos, the Moon, death, and the underworld—and fertility, the latter of which is reinforced by an enormous phallus.</p><p> The <b>Devil</b> is a shape shifter, appearing in many guises in order to trick people. His most common human shape was that of a tall black man or a tall man, often handsome, dressed in black. Black is universally associated with fear, evil, the dark, and chaos. Henri Boguet, a 16th- and 17th century jurist in witch trials, stated that “whenever he (the <b>Devil</b>) assumes the form of a man, he is, however, always black, as all witches bear witness. And for my part I hold that there are two principle reasons for this: first, that he who is the Father and Ruler of darkness may not be able to disguise himself so well that he may not always be known for what he is; secondly, as proof that his study is only to do evil; for evil, as Pythagoras said, is symbolized by black.”</p><p> When not in black, the <b>Devil</b> is most grequently in red. St. Paul stated that the <b>Devil</b> can appear disguised as an angel of light. His disguises of good also include saints, the Virgin Mary, comely young women, handsome young men, and preachers.</p><p> The <b>Devil</b> appears in a multitude of animal shapes, most commonly as a black dog, serpent, goat, or cat. He also has ugly appearances: As the alleged god of witches, he was portrayed as half-human, half-animal, like Pan, with horns, cloven feet, hairy legs, a tail, a huge penis, glowing eyes, and saturnine features.</p><p> The <b>Devil</b> appeared to Martin Luther in the form of a monk with bird claw hands, according to an account written by Georgius Godelmannus in 1591. Godelmannus relates that while he was studying law at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, he heard a story from several of his teachers about a monk who appeared and knocked hard upon the door of Luther. He was invited in and began to speak of papist errors and other theological matters. Luther grew impatient and said his time was being wasted, and the monk should consult a Bible for answers. At that point, he noticed that the monk’s hands were like bird claws. Luther showed the monk a passage in Genesis that says, \"The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent.\" Exposed, the <b>Devil</b> went into a rage, threw about Luther’s ink and writing materials, and fled, leaving behind him a stench that lasted for days.</p><p><i>The Devil as Buffoon</i><br> In legend, the <b>Devil</b> is often portrayed in a lighter fashion, perhaps to lessen the fear inspired by the clergy. He is called by nicknames such as Jack, Old Nick, Old Horny, and Lusty Dick. Buffoonish and somewhat dim-witted, he can be easily tricked, as in the numerous versions of the DEVIL’S BRIDGE, in which the <b>Devil</b> builds a bridge in return for the soul of the  to cross the bridge but is fooled when a dog or cat is sent across. In other tales, the <b>Devil</b> shoots off arrows and rocks to try to destroy villages and churches but always misses the mark. He constantly tries to makes pacts with people in order to get control of their souls but fails.</p><p><i>Devils versus Demons</i><br>In both theology and folklore, the distinction between the <b>Devil</b> as Prince of Evil and his hordes of demons often blurs. \"The Devil\" can refer to both. Joseph Glanvil observed in <i>Saducismus Triumphatus</i> (1681), \"The <b>Devil</b> is a name for a body politic, in which there are very different orders and degrees of spirits, and perhaps in as much variety of place and state, as among ourselves.\"</p>",

      "description": "<p>In Jewish demonology, an evil spirit or doomed soul that possesses a person’s body and soul, speaking through the person’s mouth and causing such torment and anguish that another personality appears to manifest itself. The term <i>Dybbuk</i> (also spelled <i>dibbuk</i>) was coined in the 17th century from the language of German and Polish Jews. It is an abbreviation of two phrases: <i>dibbuk me-ru’ah</i> (a cleavage of an evil spirit) and <i>dibbuk min ha-hizonim</i> (dibbuk from the demonic side of man). Prior to the 17th century, the <i>dybbuk</i> was one of many evil spirits called <i>ibbur</i>.</p><p> In early folklore, dybbukim were thought only to inhabit the bodies of sick persons. Possessive evil spirits are referred to in the Old Testament. For example, Samuel I describes the possession of Saul and the way David exorcized the spirit by playing the harp. In the book of Tobit he archangel Raphael instructs Tobit in ways of exorcism. In the rabbinical literature of the first century, exorcisms called for the ashes of a red heifer, or the roots of certain herbs, to be burned under the victim, who was then surrounded with water. Other methods included incantations in the name of King Solomon, repetition of the Divine Name of God, reading from Psalms, and wearing herbal amulets.</p><p> By the 16th century, the concept of possessive evil spirits changed. Many Jews believed the spirits were transmigrated souls that could not enter a new body because of their past sins and so were forced to possess the body of a living sinner. The spirits were motivated to possess a body because they were tormented by other evil spirits if they did not. Some thought the dybbukim were the souls of people who were not properly buried and, therefore, became demons.</p><p> The Kaballah contains rituals for exorcizing a dybbuk; many are still in use in modern times. The exorcism must be performed by a <i>ba'al</i> shem</i>, a miracle-working rabbi. Depending on how the exorcism is done, the dybbuk either is redeemed or is cast into Hell. It usually exits the body of its victim through the small toe, which shows a small, bloody hole as the point of departure.</p>",

Empousae means <i>forcers in</i>. <i>Empusa</i> is sometimes translated into English as “vampire.”</p><p> The <b>Empousai</b> are children of Hecate, the goddess of the underworld (see Chthonic Deities), ghosts, and magic.  They appear at her bidding at midday when people make sacrifices to their dead relatives. They are filthy and ugly. They have the hind ends of asses and wear brazen slippers. Sometimes they are described as having one brass leg and one ass leg. They disguise themselves as cows, bitches, or beautiful girls. In the latter form, they seduce men. They enter the human body to consume its flesh and drink its blood.</p><p> In <i>The Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i>, Philostratus relates a story—probably highly fictitious—about an <i>empousa</i> bride. Apollonius, a philosopher and wonder worker of the first century, was credited with great feats of magic and the ability to summon spirits and see the future. Philostratus’ biography draws upon the probably fictional memoirs of one of Apollonius’ disciples, Damis.</p><p> The story concerns a young man of Lycia, Menippus, age 25, smart and handsome. One day as he was walking along the road to Cenchreae, he was met by an apparition—an <i>empousa</i>—in the guise of a Phoenician woman. He fell under her spell and fell in love with her, not realizing what she really was. They made plans to marry.</p><p> Apollonius was skeptical of her. He attended the wedding and was introduced to her by Menippus. The woman acknowledged she was the owner of all the gold and silver trappings in the house and was the mistress of all the servants. Apollonius told Menippus that his bride was an empousa who would devour his flesh and drink his blood. Menippus’ bride was offended at this and ordered Apollonius to leave, but he had broken her spell, and all the gold, silver, and servants disappeared.</p><p> The woman wept and begged Apollonius not to force her to confess her true identity, but he did. She admitted that she was fattening up Menippus for a kill, and that she loved to dine on young and beautiful bodies because their blood was pure and strong. Thus, was Menippus saved from a gruesome fate.</p><p> A similar tale, not quite as demonic in nature, is told by Phlegon of Tralles in <i>Mirabilia 1</i>, ca. 140. Philinnion is a young bride who dies and returns as a sexually hungry ghost to visit a man, Machates. Philinnion leaves behind jewelry and underwear. Machates gives her a ring and a golden cup. When the family discovers what is going on, they visit the girl’s tomb, to find her bier empty, save for Machates’ gifts. The girl herself is lying in the house where Machates is a guest. A learned prophet says her corpse should be burned outside the city limits, and many sacrifices should be made to the chthonic deities. These acts are carried out, and Machates, in despair, commits suicide.</p>",

Adarkes asks Solomon to send someone who can control the demon.</p><p> Solomon, however, forgets about the request until he has a problem with the construction of the Temple of Jerusalem. The stone that he wishes for a cornerstone is so heavy that all the artisans and demon laborers cannot move it. Solomon sends a servant out into the Arabian desert to capture the wind demon in a leather flask. The servant places Solomon’s magic ring at the neck of the flask, which is a wineskin. When the demon blows into  it and fills it up, the servant seals it closed with the ring. The local Arabs do not believe that the boy has actually contained the demon, but when the wind does not blow for three days, they become convinced.</p><p> The boy presents the flask to Solomon inside the temple. Solomon is astonished when the fl ask has the ability to move about on its own and takes seven steps, and then falls on its neck.

      "description": "<p>A spirit that maintains regular contact with a person, sometimes acting in service or guardianship, or providing information and instruction. The term <b>Familiar</b> is from the Latin term Familiaris, meaning <i>of a household or domestic</i>.</p><p> <b>Familiars</b> can be either good or evil in nature, and they vary significantly in intelligence and powers. They assume many shapes, such as elementals, animals, birds and insects, and even spirit lovers. The shapes assumed reflect the nature of the spirit, who may be intent on deceit. Personal <b>Familiars</b> sometimes attach themselves to a family bloodline and serve generations. They can possess people and animals and are capable of acting independently of the people with whom they associate.</p><p> <b>Familiars</b> are summoned via magical ritual, given, appointed, traded, bought, and sold, or they appear of their own volition. They can be housed in bottles and rings. They have been part of shamanic and sorcery traditions around the world.</p><p><i> Early Beliefs about Familiars</i><br> The Greeks and Romans believed in <b>Familiars</b> called <i>Daimones</i>, which occupied homes, buildings, and other places and attached themselves to people. Such spirits provided advice and guidance, performed tasks, acted as servants, and did guard duty. Socrates said <i>daimones</i> whispered in his ear to warn him of danger and misfortune. Plotinus also was said to have a <b>Familiar</b>, who appeared when summoned and obeyed him and was superior to lowerranking spirits such as the genii, guardians of places.</p><p> Other early beliefs about <b>Familiars</b> cross over into the lore of fairies, elves, brownies, gnomes, and trolls. Spirits that work in mines and guard hidden treasures are sometimes called <b>Familiars</b>. The djinn summoned by King Solomon to build his Temple of Jerusalem are comparable to <b>Familiars</b>.</p><p><i>Familiars in Magic and Witchcraft</i><br> <b>Familiars</b> can be conjured magically for a variety of purposes. In esoteric lore, they are the constant attendants and servants of magicians, wizards, spell casters, and healers. Low <b>Familiars</b> are inanimate objects, such as magical books that mysteriously appear. The English magician John Dee acquired a scrying (divining) crystal inhabited by a <b>Familiar</b> spirit, which he and his assistant, Edward Kelley, used to communicate with angels and spirits. High <b>Familiars</b> assume plant, animal, and human shape. Some <b>Familiars</b> assume whatever shape is needed for their purposes. Dee had another <b>Familiar</b>, Madimi, who appeared as either a young girl or an adult. She even appeared naked when dealing with a sexual matter.</p><p> According to tradition, <b>Familiars</b> can be magically locked in bottles, rings, and stones and sometimes sold as charms for success in gambling, love, and business.</p><p> In witchcraft lore, <b>Familiars</b> are low-ranking demons or imps given by the Devil to those who commit to pacts with him. Or witches inherited <b>Familiars</b> from other witches. demonic <b>Familiars</b> were said by witch hunters to serve witches in all ways, even sexually. They carried out spells and bewitchments. Most witch <b>Familiars</b> were believed to be in animal form; some were spirits kept in bottles and flasks. Even fairies were said to be <b>Familiars</b>.</p><p> A witch could have multiple <b>Familiars</b>. Cats, especially black, were the favored forms. The fear that all cats were witches’ <b>Familiars</b> led to cat massacres in Europe.</p><p> The witch hunter Pierre de Lancre said the highest ranking witches have <b>Familiars</b> in the shape of horned frogs that sit on their left shoulder and are invisible to everyone but other witches. Some witches had <b>Familiars</b> in human form.</p><p> Other common witches’ <b>Familiars</b> were dogs, toads, mice, ferrets, weasels, birds, wasps, bees, moths, hedgehogs, rabbits, and farm animals, as well as monstrous hybrid creatures. For example, the accused English witch Elizabeth Clark (17th century) confessed to having five <b>Familiars</b>, including Vinegar Tom, a creature that looked like a greyhound with an ox’s head and could shape shift into a headless child.</p><p> <b>Familiars</b> all supposedly had grotesque names that gave away their true demonic identities. Elizabeth Francis, an accused witch in the Chelmsford, England, trials of 1556, had a white spotted cat named Sathan. Other names recorded at witch trials were Verd-Joli, Verdelet, Ilemanzar, Greedigut, Jezebel, Abrahel, Grissell, Martinet, Blackman, and Pyewackett.</p><p> Witches who were arrested and imprisoned were watched secretly to see whether their <b>Familiars</b> came to their aid. Even a fly, ant, or cockroach that went toward a witch was called a <b>Familiar</b>. Guards had to watch carefully that Familiars—believed to be assassins dispatched by the Devil—did not kill an accused witch before she could be tried.</p><p> Witches were said to take great care of their <b>Familiars</b>, suckling them with their own blood through \"witch's marks,\" small teats, discolorations, and welts upon their bodies.</p><p> Having a <b>Familiar</b> was sufficient to condemn a witch to death. In England, the witchcraft Act of 1604 made it a felony to \"consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed, or reward any evil and wicked spirit to or for any intent or purpose.\"</p><p> In contrast to the <b>Familiars</b> of the witch trials, the literary Mephistopheles is an elegant <b>Familiar</b>, usually assuming the form of a tall man in black who attends his victim, Faust, in order to subvert his soul. Faust also was accompanied by a black dog <b>Familiar</b>.</p><p> Many modern witches, Wiccans, and Pagans have <b>Familiars</b> as magical helpers. Many are animals (often cats) whose psychic attunement makes them ideal partners in magic. Some Witches turn pets into <b>Familiars</b>, and others send out \"calls\" on the psychic planes to draw in the right animal. Others create <b>Familiars</b> from astral thought forms.</p><p> <b>Familiars</b> attend rituals and protect against negative spirits. They are sensitive to psychic vibrations and power and are welcome partners inside the magic circle for the raising of power, the casting of spells, scrying, spirit contact, and other magical work. They also serve as psychic radar, reacting visibly to the presence of any negative or evil energy, whether it be an unseen force or a person who dabbles in the wrong kind of magic. <b>Familiars</b> are given psychic protection by their witches.</p><p> <i>Sexual Familiars</i><br> Spirits enjoy human sexual intercourse, either by drawing energy from people engaged in it or by assuming or possessing a human form in order to participate in sex directly. Depending on the nature of a <b>Familiar</b>, it enjoys the higher spiritual nature of sex or the lustful physical nature of it. A <b>Familiar</b> might try to influence a sexual encounter by prolonging it as long as possible. It usually presses on top of a person or lies alongside him or her. A person feels a sexual encounter with a <b>Familiar</b> as intense waves of physical pleasure. <b>Familiars</b> can engage in sex by possessing a person’s body and generating internal sensations of pleasure, by possessing a person’s human lover to manipulate his or her hands and body, and by causing erotic dreams.</p><p> The low, demonic types of spirit sexual encounters are with an Incubus (male demon) or Succubus (female demon). During the witch hysteria, witches were said to copulate with demon lovers, and demons masquerading as seductive humans attacked sleeping people at night and raped them.</p><p><i>Problems with Familiars</i><br> Frequent contact with <b>Familiars</b> can result in nightmares, physical injuries caused by <b>Familiars</b>, and also obsession, in which a person sees, hears, and feels an influencing spirit, and possession  in which the <b>Familiar</b> completely takes over a person.</p><p> Also, spirits do not always distinguish between truth and falsehood, and so discernment must be applied to whatever information they impart. <b>Familiars</b> can manifest as voices in the head that cause compulsive, aberrant behavior, including self-inflicted wounds, suicide, and violence toward others. Excessive and draining contact with them can create mental, emotional, and physical strain and breakdown.</p><p> <b>Familiars</b> that create problems can be banished by ending all engagement with them or, if necessary, by ritual banishment.</p>",

The blessed are sent to the Elysian Fields, the wicked are sent to Tartarus, and those who are neither are sent to the Fields of Asphodel.</p><p> The wicked are unhappy and suffer, but not at the hand of demons.</p><p> Early Christians used the term Hades to translate the Hebrew term Sheol, the land of the dead. </p><p><i>Zoroastrianism</i><br> In Zoroastrianism, <b>Hell</b> is created in the middle earth by Ahriman, the personification of ultimate evil. In his battle against Ohrmazd, the good god, Ahriman attacks the earth, ripping apart the sky, thereby creating night. He hurtles toward the earth and bores straight through it, making a tunnel. This hole becomes <b>hell</b>, infested with demons. Damned souls are sent here to suffer extremes of heat and cold, loathsome stenches, rotting food, and the torments of demons, who gnaw, swallow, and pierce the damned with spears. The extent of punishment is suited to the crimes and sins of the souls. Souls who are neither wholly good nor wholly evil go to a purgatory-like place, Hamegstan, a shadowy and oppressive realm with extremes of heat and cold. Being sent to <b>hell</b> is not permanent, however. At the Last Judgement, all sin is purged.</p><p> After death, the soul spends three days sitting at the head of its body praying for its future. Then, it must cross a river swollen with the tears of weeping loved ones. If too many tears have been shed, the river cannot be crossed. The soul is aided by its guardian angel. If the river is crossed, the soul then arrives at the Chinvat Bridge, or <i>Bridge of the Requiter</i>, to meet three angels of judgment: Mithra, Srosh, and Rashnu. The deeds of the soul are weighed. Depending on the good or evil reckoning, the bridge is wide and easily crossed, or sharp and narrow, causing the wicked to fall into <b>hell</b>.</p><p> One text, The Book of Arda Viraf, describes <b>hell</b> in detail as a gloomy, stinking, fiery, and depressing abode. There are four  hills: Dush-humat, the place of evil thoughts; Dush-hukht, the place of evil words; Dushhuvarsht, the place of evil deeds; and Chakat-i-Daitih, a desert and dark stinking pit full of demons below the Chinvat Bridge. The deepest pit is Drûgâskan, a place so dark that the sense of sight is lost.</p><p> Punishments fit the nature of sins; 85 are described in The Book of Arda Viraf from the sixth century. Eighty-five of its 101 chapters concern <b>hell</b>. The visionary is Arda Viraf, who travels to both heaven and <b>hell</b> with two guides: Srosh the pious and Ataro, an angel. Besides witnessing landscapes and tortures of <b>hell</b>, Arda Viraf sees Angra Mainyu, the deadly world destroyer later known as Ahriman.</p><p> Unlike the Christian <b>hell</b> to come, demons do not force the punishments upon the damned; rather, the damned infl ict the punishments on themselves, while demons look on. The most common punishment is eating fetid and putrid things for thousands of years until the final resurrection. Other punishments include the eating of their own corpses, flesh, and excrement, menstrual fluids and semen, blood and brains from skulls of the dead, and their own children. Tortures also include hanging (particularly upside-down), dismemberment, decapitation, laceration, mutilation and self-mutilation by cutting, gnawing, devouring, gnashing, piercing, beating, tearing, trampling, stinging, and dragging. The wicked are stabbed and pelted and stretched on racks; they are forced to bear enormous burdens and perform painful and fruitless tasks; are burned and cooked in ovens, cauldrons, and frying-pans; are cast down into heat, cold, smoke, snow, and stench. They endure hunger and thirst, and they are forced to lick hot things or to defecate and masturbate continually; they are submerged in mud and turned into SERPENTs. Their eyes are gouged out and their tongues pulled out; putrid substances are forced into their noses, eyes, and mouths. Their penises are gnawed and their breasts are gnashed and cut off.</p><p> Fire is present in the Zoroastrian <b>hell</b> but is not an instrument of torture; instead, hot implements and objects and molten metal are used against the damned. </p><p><i>Judaism</i><br> Sheol (place of the dead) is a shadowy place under the earth where souls continue their existence in the afterlife. The equivalent Greek term for the Hebrew <i>Sheol</i> is <i>Hades</i>, but as a place after death, not as a place of punishment. Daniel 12:2, which concerns the coming of the messianic kingdom, expresses the conviction that God will not abandon souls in Sheol: \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and contempt.\"</p><p> All souls go initially to Sheol (with the exception of a few righteous ones whom God takes straight to heaven). In 3 Enoch, two angels of destruction escort “intermediate” souls (those equally good and bad) and wicked souls to Sheol. The intermediate souls are purified in fire in order to be fi tting in God’s presence. They have spiritual forms that are human faces with eagle bodies. The faces are green because of the taint of their sin and will remain so until they are purified.</p><p> The wicked souls, whose faces are as black as the bottoms of pots because of their sins, are taken by an angel to Gehenna (hell) for punishment. Gehenna or Gehinnom (Valley of Hinnom) is associated with the literal valley of Hinnom south of Jerusalem, where human sacrifi ces were made to MOLOCH. Different accounts exist concerning the creation of Gehenna: it was created by God on the second day, or it existed before the world and its  was created on the second day. It exists either above the fi rmament, behind dark mountains, or deep within the earth. Its fire is 60 times hotter than any  on Earth and is never extinguished. It stinks of sulfur. Sinners go immediately to Gehenna, where they are punished in terrible pain for eternity.</p><p><i>Christianity</i><br> In orthodox Christianity, <b>hell</b> has four levels. The first two are limbo regions for pre-Christian souls, now unoccupied, and for the souls of unbaptized children. The third is purgatory, where most mortals go prior to admission to heaven. The duration of their stay depends upon the gravity of their sins. The fourth is <b>hell</b> itself, reserved for eternal punishment of the damned, who have no hope of redemption.</p><p> <b>Hell</b> exists in the bowels of the earth. Earthquakes are produced by the convulsions of the damned, according to orthodox belief. </p><p>There are three gates to <b>hell</b>: in the inhabited land, in the wilderness, and at the bottom of the sea. In the Middle Ages, caves were considered to be the entry points to <b>hell</b>.</p><p> <b>Hell</b> is characterized by extremes of temperature. There are unbearable furnaces and pitch and flames, and extreme cold, ice, and frigidity. The damned are punished according to their sins, and in ways similar to the descriptions of the Zoroastrian <b>hell</b>. Their bodies are tortured and ripped apart by demons; they are subjected to piercings and hanging in agonizing postures, such as by their tongues or breasts. They have their organs and flesh devoured; they eat excrement and filth. They have their genitals and breasts mutilated. Worms crawl in and out of their eyes.</p><p> <i>Islam</i><br> Jahnnam is the Islamic <b>hell</b>, the destination of not only criminals but infi dels and those who do not believe in God. The damned are forced to eat bitter fruit from a tree called Zaqqum and endure a host of other tortures. The Qur’an emphasizes the torments of <b>hell</b> for wayward Muslims. The guilty are \"bound with chains\", their garments pitch, and their faces covered with flames” (sura 14:49–50). For those who oppose God’s message, \"Hell will stretch behind them, and putrid water shall he drink: he will sip, but scarcely swallow. Death will assail him from every side, yet he shall not die. Harrowing torment awaits him\" (sura 14:16–17), and \"Garments of  have been prepared for the unbelievers. Scalding water shall be poured upon their heads, melting their skins and that which is in their bellies. They shall be lashed with rods of iron\" (sura 22:19–20).</p><p> <i>Visits to Hell</i><br>Numerous religious figures and visionaries have visited one or both sides of the afterlife. Zarathustra (Zoroaster) was said to have made midnight trips to both heaven and <b>Hell</b>, as did Moses. There is a tradition that Jesus went to <b>Hell</b> for three days between his Crucifixion and ascension to heaven. The Bible makes no clear reference to it, but the statement that Jesus went to hell is in the Apostles’ Creed. 1 Peter 3:19 says that Jesus went to preach to \"the spirits in prison\", a reference interpreted as meaning <b>hell</b>.</p><p> Emmanuel Swedenborg had numerous out-of-body visits to the afterlife, and St. John Bosco visited <b>hell</b> in vivid lucid dreams.</p>",

He can assume any form, but he is most frequently portrayed as a vain entity who has the head of an ass and is decorated with peacock feathers (see Adremelech).</p><p> <b>Iblis</b> is mentioned nine times in the Qur’an; seven of the references concern his fall from God’s grace. His other name, Shaytan, is used in context of his rebellion against God.</p><p> Sura 18:50 in the Qur’an states that <b>Iblis</b> \"was one of the djinn, and he broke the command his Lord.\" Like other djinn, <b>Iblis</b> was created by God of smokeless fire. Suras 7:12 and 38:76 refer to his creation from fire.</p><p> However, the Qur’an also indicates that <b>Iblis</b> was treated as an angel. When Allah created Adam, he ordered all the angels to bow down and worship him. <b>Iblis</b> was among those who refused, claiming that a being made of dust was beneath him, a being of fire. Allah cursed <b>Iblis</b> for his pride and expelled him from heaven. <b>Iblis</b> persuaded Allah to delay further punishment until the Day of Judgment.

He was made a judge of djinn, a job that he performed well for 1,000 years and poorly for 1,000 years. He was then rehabilitated but refused Allah’s command to worship Adam and was punished.</p><p> In another legend, in a time before the creation of humankind, Allah sent his angels down to Earth to destroy the djinn, who were rebelling against divine laws.

The imp started breaking things in the angel Choir and was turned to stone by angels in punishment.</p><p> Another version says that in the 14th century, the Devil sent two imps out to make mischief.

They tripped the bishop and smashed tables and chairs and started to destroy the angel Choir. An angel ordered them to stop. One of the imps defiantly flew up to a stone pillar and began to throw heavy objects at the angel. The angel turned him into stone, leaving him there forever.

      "name": "Incubus",
      "description": "<p>A lewd male demon who pursues women for sex. In Hebrew mythology, the <b>Incubus</b> and his female counterpart, the Succubus, visit women and men in their sleep, lie and press heavily upon them, and seduce them. They can be conjured by witches, sorcerers, and shamans. During the witch hysteria in Europe, incubi were believed to instruments of the Devil, tormenting people for the sole purpose of degrading their souls and perverting them to more vices. <b>Incubus</b> attacks are reported in modern possession cases.</p><p> <b>Incubus</b> is from the Latin word <i>incubare</i>, which means \"to lie upon\". Victims usually feel a heavy weight on top of them that paralyzes them. Sometimes there is a sense of choking or suffocation. The Greeks referred to the phenomenon as <i>ephialtes</i>, or <i>the pouncer</i>. Another Greek term is <i>pnigalion</i>, or <i>suffocation</i>. Pliny called it <i>suppressions</i> or <i>nocturnal illusions</i>.</p><p><i> The Incubus in Jewish demonology</i><br>The existence and activities of incubi are acknowledged in Jewish demonology in relation to a Midrashic legend of Adam’s siring demonic offspring. According to the kabbalistic text the Zohar, these unions are continued by men who unknowingly cohabit with spirits in their sleep.  The hybrid human-demonic children have a demonic nature and rank high in the echelons of demons, occupying positions of authority and rulership. Thus, demons value intercourse with humans.</p><p> <i>The Incubus in the Early Christian Church</i><br> According to some of the fathers of the church, among them St. Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian, as well as the Jewish historian Josephus and some Platonist philosophers, the incubi were the Sons of God, angels who fell from heaven because they copulated with women. Their offspring were giants, the Nephilim, who could not have been the progeny of human men and women.</p><p> St. Augustine included among incubi the pagan demigods sylvans and fauns, who were exceptionally lascivious and often injured women in their lust, he said.</p><p><i>The Incubus during the European Inquisition</i><br>During the witch hunts, demonologists wrote handbooks on witches, the Devil, and demons. They described the appearances, behavior, and characteristics of incubi and remedies against them.</p><p> Incubi are especially attracted to women with beautiful hair, young virgins, chaste widows, and all \"devout\" females. Nuns are among the most vulnerable and could be molested in the confessional as well as in bed. While the majority of women are forced into sex by the incubi, some of them submit willingly and even enjoy the act. It once was a common belief that women were more likely than men to be the sexual victims of demons, because women were inferior to men and less able to resist temptation.</p><p> Incubi have enormous phalluses that are so stiff they cause women great pain. According to the French demonologist Nicholas Remy, a woman accused as a witch in Haraucourt in 1586 described her demon’s penis as as long as a kitchen tool and without testicles or scrotum. Another accused witch, a woman named Didatia of Miremont, said at her trial in 1588 that she was \"always so stretched by the huge, swollen member of her demon that the sheets were drenched with blood.\" Some <b>Incubus</b> penises were described as scaly, like the skin of a reptile.</p><p> Incubi are not interested in procreation, only in degrading sex. However, they have the ability to impregnate women. They do not possess their own semen; they collect it from men in nocturnal emissions, masturbation, or coitus while the demons are masquerading as succubi. The incubi have the power to preserve semen and use it later on one of their victims. demonic semen is described as frigid and icy cold.</p><p> The children that result may be considered the children of the man who unwittingly provided the semen. Some old horror stories held that the children were half-human and half-beast. Remy described monstrous half-demon children with two mouths, two heads, six s, two sets of teeth, beards, four eyes, three hands, and three feet. Others were missing limbs or had one eye in the middle of their forehead or in their knee. Some had no human form but were shapeless masses like sponges. Remy recounted an eyewitness description of an <b>Incubus</b> child:</p><p class=\"indent\"> It had a hooked beak, a long smooth neck, quivering eyes, a pointed tail, a strident voice, and very swift feet upon which it ran rapidly to and fro as if seeking for some hiding-place in its stable.</p><p> Some of the offspring once were called Adamitici, as though they were descended in an unbroken line from Adam. Because of the defective semen, these infants cried or hissed continually, were emaciated but heavy, and sucked all their nurses dry. They also were attributed the superpowers of pagan demigods and heroes.</p><p> Remy said monstrous births were due to the \"lustful imagination of a prurient woman\" and not to demon semen. He cited Empedocles, who said that the likeness of a child is caused by impressions the mother experienced at the time of conception. If a woman had frequent intercourse with an <b>Incubus</b>, it affected her imagination, which in turn gave the child a savage appearance.</p><p> In a small number of witchcraft cases, claims of molestation by incubi were dismissed as the products of female melancholia or vivid imagination. False pregnancies that arose from this state were chalked up to flatulence.</p><p> Witches were said to copulate willingly with incubi, especially at a SABBAT. The inquisitors’ handbook the Malleus Maleficarum (1487), stated that \"in times long past the Incubus Devils used to infest women against their wills,\" but \"modern witches...willingly embrace this most foul and miserable servitude.\" Some incubi served as <i>Familiars</i> to witches, who sent them to torment specific individuals.</p><p> Since sex with incubi was expected of witches, many accused witches were tortured until they confessed this crime. In 1485, the inquisitor of Como sent 41 women to their deaths at the stake. Their \"confessions\" of sex with incubi, among other witchcraft crimes, were corroborated by eyewitness accounts, as well as by hearsay evidence \"and the testimony of credible witnesses.\"</p><p> Incubi were believed to be always visible to witches but only occasionally visible to others, even the victims. There were reports of people observed in the throes of passion with no one but themselves visible. Husbands saw incubi as they copulated with their wives but thought they were other men.</p><p> Incubi preyed on ordinary people as well as witches. Francsco-Maria Guazzo related a story in <i>Compendium Maleficarum</i> (1608) about a beautiful noble girl who refused to marry men of her station but instead fell into an affair with an <b>Incubus</b>. She freely told her parents of the marvelous sex they had at night and sometimes during the day. One night, the parents, a priest, and others bolted the house doors and went into their daughter’s bedroom with lit torches. There they found her in the embrace of a hideous demon, \"a horrible monster whose appearance was terrible beyond human imagination.\" The priest immediately began reciting the Gospel of John. When he said, \"The Word was made flesh\", the demon shrieked, set fire to all the furniture, and left, carrying with him the roof of the bedroom. The girl immediately gave birth to a <i>loathsome monster</i>. The midwives built a large fire and burned it.</p><p> The church prescribed five ways to get rid of incubi:<div class=\"li-indent\"><li>by sacramental confession</li><li>by making the sign of the cross</li><li>by reciting the Ave Maria</li><li>by moving to another house or town</li><li>by excommunication of the demon by holy men.</li></div><p> Other remedies included a recitation of the Lord’s Prayer and the sprinkling of holy water.</p><p> Not all theologians and demonologists agreed that sex with demons was possible. St. Thomas Aquinas said that sex with a demon exceeds their natural powers but is in keeping with their malice and therefore might be permitted by God in accordance with the sins of a person. Johann Weyer dismissed incubi and succubi as “purely imaginary, the result of an impaired mind.” He also dismissed as “bizarre fiction” the idea that incubi could impregnate a woman by borrowing a man’s semen in the guise of succubi. Such stories of demonic seduction were the products of “gullible historians,” he said.</p><p> Montague Summers compiled quotations from earlier writings and countered in <i>The History of Witchcraft and Demonology</i> (1926) that “great Saints and scholars and all moral theologians of importance affirm the possibility of commerce with incarnate evil intelligences.</p>",

      "name": "Kabbalah (Cabala, Kabala, Qabalah)",
      "description": "<p>The mysticism of classical Judaism, and part of the foundation of the Western magical tradition.</p><p><i>Kabbalah</i> is derived from the Hebrew word <i>QBL</i> (<i>Qibel</i>), meaning \"to receive\" or \"that which is received.\" It refers especially to a secret oral tradition handed down from teacher to pupil. The term <i>Kabbalah</i> was first used in the 11th century by Ibn Gabirol, a Spanish philosopher, and has since become applied to all Jewish mystical practice. <b>The Kabbalah</b> is founded on the Torah, but it is not an intellectual or ascetic discipline. It is a means for achieving union with God while maintaining an active life in the mundane world.</p><p><i>Branches of the Kabbalah</i><br>There are four main, overlapping branches of the Kabbalah:<p class=\"indent\">1. The Classical, or Dogmatic, Kabbalah concerns the study of the Torah and the central texts of the Kabbalah, such as the Sefer Yetzirah and the Sefer Zohar (see later discussion). 2. The Practical Kabbalah concerns MAGIC, such as the proper ways to make TALISMANs and AMULETs, and lore about ANGELs and DEMONs. 3. The Literal Kabbalah concerns the relationship between the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and numbers. It features the deciphering of relationships and correspondences through gematria, a system for determining the numerical values of words and names; the fi nding of acronyms through notarikon, in which the first letters of words are used to make new words; and an encryption system called temurah, in which letters are transposed into code. Temurah plays a role in interpreting the Torah and in making talismans. 4. The Unwritten Kabbalah concerns the study of the Tree of Life (discussed later).</p><p>Of the four branches, the Practical Kabbalah, Literal Kabbalah, and Unwritten Kabbalah are the most important to the Western mystery tradition. Joined with Hermetic principles and philosophy, these parts of the Kabbalah create a philosophical, mystical, and magical system for the practice of ceremonial magic. This system, sometimes called the “Western Kabbalah” or “Western Qabalah,” also plays a role in practical magic for the casting of spells.</p><p><i>History of the Kabbalah</i><br>According to lore, God taught what became the Kabbalah to ANGELS. After the Fall, angels taught the knowledge to Adam in order to provide humans a way back to God. The knowledge was passed to Noah, then to Abraham and Moses, who in turn initiated 70 elders. Kings David and SOLOMON were initiates. Influenced by Gnosticism and Neoplatonism, the oral tradition was passed on into the tradition and literature of the Merkabah mystics (ca. 100 B.C.E.–1000 C.E.).</p><p>Merkabah means “God’s Throne-Chariot” and refers to the chariot of Ezekiel’s vision. The goal of the Merkabahmystic was to enter the throne world and perceive God sitting upon his throne. The throne world was reached after passing through seven heavens while in an ecstatic trance state. The passage of the mystic was dangerous, impeded by hostile angels. Talismans, SEALs, the sacred names of angels, and incantations were required to navigate through the obstacles.</p><p>The historical origin of the true Kabbalah centers on the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation), attributed to Rabbi Akiba, whom the Romans martyred. The book’s exact date of origin is unknown. It was in use in the 10th century, but it may have been authored as early as the third century.</p><p> The Sefer Yetzirah presents a discussion on cosmology and cosmogony and sets forth the central structure of the Kabbalah. It also is reputed to contain the formula for creation of a golem, an artificial human.</p><p>In 917, a form of practical kabbalism was introduced by Aaron ben Samuel in Italy; it later spread through Germany and became known as German kabbalism or Early Hasidim. It drew upon the Merkabah practices, in that it was ecstatic, had magic rituals, and had as primary techniques prayer, contemplation, and meditation. The magical power of words and names assumed great importance and gave rise to the techniques of gematria, notarikon, and <i>temurah</i>.</p><p>The Classical Kabbalah was born in the 13th century in Provence, France, and moved into Spain, where it was developed most extensively by medieval Spanish Jews. The primary work from which Classical Kabbalah developed is the Sefer Zohar (Book of Splendor), attributed to a second-century sage, Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai, but actually written between 1280 and 1286 by the Spanish kabbalist Moses de Leon. According to lore, the book comprises the teachings given to Rabbi Simeon by divine revelation.</p><p>The teachings of the Zohar became known as the Spanish Kabbalah and spread into Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. After the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, Kabbalah study became more public. Isaac Luria Ashkenazi (1534–72), called the Ari Luria, a student of the great Kabbalist Moses Cordovero (1522–70), conceived of bold new theories, which gave the Kabbalah a new terminology and complex new symbolism. Luria emphasized letter combinations as a medium for meditation and mystical prayer.</p><p>In the 14th century, a Practical Kabbalah developed, involving magical techniques for making amulets and talismans and for invoking spirits. The Practical Kabbalah is complex and features the use of magical alphabets, secret codes of communication with angels.</p><p>The Hasidic movement emerged from the Lurianic Kabbalah and made Kabbalah accessible to the masses.</p><p> The Hasidim are the only major branch of modern Judaism to follow mystical practices. Interest in the Kabbalah among Jews declined after the 18th century. The reconstructionist movement, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, borrows from Hasidic traditions and espouses a more mystical Judaism. Interest in Kabbalah enjoyed a cross-cultural renewal that began in the late 20th century as part of a broad interest in esoteric subjects.</p><p>Western occult interest in the Kabbalah grew first out of German kabbalism and then Lurianic kabbalism. Christian occultists were attracted to the magical amulets, incantations, demonology, angelology, seals, and letter permutations, and they used these as the basis for ritual magical texts (see GRIMOIRES). The Tetragrammaton (<i>YHVH, Yod He Vau He, or Yahweh</i>, the sacred name of God) was held in great awe for its power over all things in the universe, including demons, a subject of intense fear and interest.</p><p>In the late 15th century, the Kabbalah was harmonized with Christian doctrines, which supposedly proved the divinity of Christ. Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim included Kabbalah in his monumental work, Occult Philosophy (1531). Also in the 16th century, alchemical symbols were integrated into the Christian Kabbalah.</p><p>Interest in the Kabbalah received renewed attention in the 19th century from non-Jewish occultists such as Francis Barrett, Eliphas Levi, and Papus. Levi’s works were especially important in the occult revival that spread through Europe in the 19th century. As did some of his contemporaries, Levi related the Kabbalah to the Tarot and numerology and drew connections to Freemasonry, in which he saw a fusion of Judaic kabbalism and Neoplatonic Christianity. The Kabbalah, he said in The Book of Splendors, is one of three occult sciences of certitude; the other two are Magic and Hermeticism. Of the Kabbalah, Levi said:</p><p class=\"indent\">The Qabalah, or traditional science of the Hebrews, might be called the mathematics of human thought. It is the algebra of faith. It solves all problems of the soul as equations, by isolating the unknowns. It gives to ideas the clarity and rigorous exactitude of numbers; its results, for the mind, are infallibility always relative to the sphere of human knowledge) and for the heart,profound peace.</p><p>The Kabbalah formed a central part of the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, one of the most significant esoteric orders in the Western mystery tradition, which flourished in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1888, the Golden Dawn founder, Samuel Liddle Macgregor Mathers, published the first English translation of a Latin translation of the Kabbalah, Kabbala Denuda, by Knorr von Rosenroth. In his introduction, Mathers describes the Kabbalah as the key that unlocks the mysteries of the Bible.</p><p><i>Central Concepts of the Kabbalah</i><br>God is Ain Soph (without end or unending), who is unknowable, unnamable, and beyond representation. Godcreated the world out of himself but is not diminished in any way through the act of creation; everything remains within him. The aim of human beings is to realize union with the divine. All things are reflected in a higher world, and nothing can exist independently of all else. Thus, humans, by elevating their soul to unite with God, also elevate all other entities in the cosmos.</p><p>One of the mysteries of the Kabbalah is why God chose to create imperfect, lower worlds, though it is held that he did so because he wished to show the measure of his goodness. He created the world by means of 32 secret paths of wisdom, which are formed of letters and numbers: the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet and 10 sephirot (from the Hebrew word for sapphire), which are vessels bearing the emanations of God, or are expressions of God. They form a language that substitutes for God. The sephirot are the source from which all numbers emanate and by which all reality is structured.</p><p>The sephirot comprise the sacred, unknowable, and unspeakable personal name of God: YHVH (Yahweh), the Tetragrammaton. So sacred is the Tetragrammaton that other names, such as Elohim, Adonai, and Jehovah, are substituted in its place in Scripture. The letters YHVH correspond to the Four Worlds that constitute the cosmos:</p><p>• Atziluth is the world of archetypes and emanation, from which are derived all forms of manifestation. The sephirot themselves exist here. Atziluth is the realm of contemplation. • Briah (also Beriyah) is the world of creation, in which archetypal ideas become patterns. The Throne of God is here, and God sits upon it and lowers his essence to the rest of his creation. It is the realm of meditation. • Yetzirah is the world of formation, in which the patterns are expressed. It is the world of speech and the realm of ritual magic.• Assiah is the world of the material. It is the realm of action in daily life.</p><p><i>Demonology in the Kabbalah</i><br>Most of the demon lore is part of the Practical Kabbalah, a syncretic blend of Talmudic and Midrashic lore, and adapted Arabian, Christian, and Eastern European demonologies and folk beliefs. As in most demonologies, there are contradictions about demons, their nature and duties. Various texts have long lists of individual demons and types of demons.</p><p>Demons are made of fire and air and live in wastelands. They are associated with cold and the north. They have subtle bodies that allow them to fly through the air; they occupy the space between the Moon and Earth. They have life spans and die, but they live much longer than human beings, especially their kings and queens. Some, such as LILITH and Naamah, will live until Judgment Day.</p><p>Demons are often described as under the direction of SAMAEL. Demons gather at nocturnal revelries, where they have intercourse with Samael, similar to the SABBATs attended by witches in Christian demonology.</p><p>Other demons are under the direction of Ashmedai (ASMODEUS), whose name in gematria means “pharaoh.”Demons also are linked to the left-hand, or evil, side of the sephirot of the Tree of Life (see later discussion).</p><p>Sexual activities between demons and humans are prominent. Demons cannot reproduce on their own. Through sex, demons can multiply and take on physical form. Adam spawned a hybrid human-demon race, which has continued on down through the ages through the sexual intercourse between humans and demons. Adam and Eve’s sons, Cain and Abel, were tainted with the impurity of the SERPENT who slept with Eve and spawned demonic children as well.</p><p>The hybrid demon-human children who continue to  be born are banim shovavim (mischievous sons). When a man dies, they attend his funeral, lament him, and claim their inheritance. They will even injure the legitimate sons in order to get what they want. In the 17th century, folk customs arose to repel these demons. Sometimes legitimate sons were forbidden to accompany the corpse of their father to the cemetery. The illegitimate demons also were repelled by circling a grave.</p><p>Demons are assigned to all things in creation, with angels as their counterparts. They can be summoned, commanded, and repelled in magical rituals according to their hours, days,months, planetary aspects, fumes, and seals.</p><p><i>The Tree of Life</i><br>The sephirot form the central image of kabbalistic meditation, the Tree of Life, a ladder map that depicts the descent of the divine into the material world, and the path by which humans can ascend to the divine while still in the flesh. The sephirot channel streams of divine light that become denser and coarser as they near the material plane. The divine light flows both down to the material world and up to God along these paths.<i>Organization of the Tree</i> Each sephirah is a state of consciousness and a level of attainment in knowledge: mystical steps to unity with God. The 10 sephirot are arranged in different groups, which facilitate the understanding of their meanings. The sephirah, Kether (Crown), is the closest to Ain Soph and is the source of all life and the highest object of prayer. Malkuth (Kingdom) penetrates the physical realm and is the only sephirah in direct contact with it. The lower seven sephirot are associated with the seven days of creation. Another division splits them into two groups of fi ve, the upper ones representing hidden powers and the lower fi ve representing manifest powers.</p><p>In another division, the top three—Kether, Chockmah (Wisdom), and Binah (Intelligence)—are associated with the intellect; the middle three—Chesed (Love), Geburah (Strength), and Tipareth (Beauty)—are associated with the soul; and the lower three—Netzach (Victory), Hod (Splendor), and Yesod (Foundation)—are associated with nature.</p><p>Each sephirah is governed by angels and demons. The demonic forces represent chaos and turbulence and are used in black magical practices.</p><p>The sephirot are ineffable, and descriptions of them cannot begin to approach their true essence. They can be reached only through the second sephirah, Chockmah (Wisdom), which is nonverbal consciousness. Binah (Intelligence) is verbal consciousness. One must learn to oscillate between Chockmah and Binah states of consciousness in order to grasp the sephirot.</p><p>The tree is split into three pillars. The Right Pillar, masculine, represents Mercy and includes the sephirot Chockmah, Chesed, and Netzach. The Left Pillar, feminine, represents Severity and includes Binah, Geburah, and Hod. The Middle represents Mildness or Moderation and includes Kether, Tipareth, Yesod, and Malkuth. The Middle Pillar alone also is called the Tree of Knowledge.</p><p>Sometimes an 11th sephirah is included, Daath (Knowledge), located on the Middle Pillar below Chockmah and Binah, and mediates the influences of the two; it is also considered to be an external aspect of Kether. Daath made its appearance in the 13th century. When represented on the Tree, it is depicted as a sort of shadow sphere. Daath cannot be a true sephirah, for the Sefer Yetzirah, the key text of kabbalistic philosophy, states that there can be only 10 sephirot, no more, no less.</p><p>The pathways linking the sephirot have become more complex over time. Illustrations in the early 16th century, for example, depict only 16 pathways. By the 17th century, there were 22 pathways, each of which was assigned a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus, God’s Creation is made through the essences of numbers and letters.</p><p.Together the sephiroth of the Tree of Life compose a unity and create a five-dimensional continuum: the three dimensions of the physical world, plus time, plus the spiritual realm. As do the Akashic Records, they serve as a permanent record of everything that has ever taken place and ever will take place—the memory of God. The sephirot also serve as a means of communication with the unknowable God. The totality of the sephirot is expressed in the Tetragrammaton, the sacred and unspeakable name of God, given as YHVH (Yahweh), or \"the Lord.\"</p><p>Following are the names and associations of the sephirot, as given in Agrippa’s Occult Philosophy:</p>      <p>KETHER<div class=\"left-indent\"><i><p><i>Numbers</i>: One</i><br><i><i>Titles</i>:</i> The Crown, The Ancient One, The Aged,  The Most Holy Ancient One, The Ancient of the Ancient Ones, The Ancient of Days, The Concealed of the Concealed, The Primordial Point, The Smooth Point, The White Head, The Inscrutable Height, The Vast Countenance (Macroprosopus), The Heavenly Man<br><i>Divine Name</i>: Eheieh (I Am)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Metatron<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Hayyoth (The Holy Living Creatures)<br><i>Archdemons</i>: Satan, Moloch<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Thamiel (The Two Contenders)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Primum Mobile<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Head</div></p><p>CHOCKMAH<br><div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Number</i>: Two<br><i><i>Titles</i></i>: Wisdom, Divine Father, The Supernal Father<br><i>Divine Names</i>: Jah, Jehovah (The Lord), Yod Jehovah (given by Agrippa)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Raziel<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Ophanim (The Wheels)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Beelzebub<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Ghogiel (The Hinderers)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Zodiac<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Brain</p></div></p><p>BINAH<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Number</i>: Three<br><i><i>Titles</i></i>: Intelligence, The Mother, The Great Productive Mother<br><i>Divine Names</i>: Elohim (Lord), Jehovah Elohim (The Lord God)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Tzaphkiel<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Aralim (The Thrones)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Lucifuge<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Ghogiel (The Concealers)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Saturn<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Heart</div></p><p>CHESED<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Number</i>: Four<br><i><i>Titles</i></i>: Love, Greatness<br><i>Divine Name</i>: El (The Mighty One)<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Hasmallim (The Shining Ones)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Ashtaroth<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Agshekeloh (The Smiters or Breakers)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Jupiter<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Right arm</p></div></p><p>GEBURAH<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Numbers</i>: Five<br><i>Titles</i>: Strength, Judgment or Severity, Fear<br><i>Divine Names</i>: Eloh (The Almighty), Elohim Gabor (God of Battles)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Camael<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Seraphim (The Fiery Serpents)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Asmodeus<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Golohab (The Burners or Flaming Ones)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Marrs<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Left arm</p></div></p>TIPHARETH<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Numbers</i>: Six<br><i>Titles</i>: Beauty, Compassion, The King, The Lesser Countenance (Microprosopus)<br> <i>Divine Names</i>: Eloah Va-Daath (God Manifest), Elohim (God)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Raphael<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Malachim (Kings or Multitudes)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Belphegor<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Tagiriron (The Disputers)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Sun<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Chest</p></div></p><p>NETZACH<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Numbers</i>: Seven<br><i>Titles</i>: Firmness, Victory<br><i>Divine Name</i>: Jehovah Sabaoth (Lord of Hosts)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Haniel<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Elohim (Gods)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Baal<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Nogah (The Raveners)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Venus<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Right leg</p></div></p><p>HOD<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Numbers</i>: Eight<br><i>Titles</i>: Splendor<br><i>Divine Name</i>: Elohim Sabaoth (God of Hosts)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Michael<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Bene Elohim (Sons of Gods)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Adrammelech<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Samael (The False Accusers)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Mercury<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Left leg</p></div></p><p><div class=\"full-width\">YESOD<div class=\"left-indent\"><i>Numbers</i>: Nine<br><i>Titles</i>: The Foundation, Eternal Foundation of the World<br><i>Divine Names</i>: Shaddai (The Almighty), El Chai (Mighty Living One)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Gabriel<br><i>Angelic Order</i>: Cherubim (The Strong)<br><i>Archdemon</i>: Lilith (The Seducer)<br><i>Demonic Order</i>: Gamaliel (The Obscene Ones)<br><i>Heavenly Sphere</i>: Moon<br><i>Part of Man</i>: Genitals</p></div></p></div><p>MALKUTH<div class=\"left-indent\"><p><i>Numbers</i>: Ten<br><i>Titles</i>: The Kingdom, The Diadem, The Manifest Glory of God, The Bride (of Microposopus), The Queen<br><i>Divine Names</i>: Adonai (Lord), Adonai Malekh (Lord and King), Adonai he-Aretz (Lord of Earth)<br><i>Archangel</i>: Metatron in manifest aspect;

      "name": "Kitsune",
      "description": "<p>In Japanese lore, a wild fox demon that causes possession. The <i>kitsune</i> also appears in the form of a beautiful maiden, who vampirizes her victims sexually as a succubus. The <b>kitsune</b> appears in many Japanese folktales and in the literature about possession. It originated in the lore of China, where it is described as a lewd creature, the <i>huli jing</i>.</p><p><i>Possession</i><br>Possession by the fox demon is called kitsune-tsuki. Cases have been recorded in Japan since the 12th century. Some are believed to be revenge for a family’s former offenses against a huli jing.</p><p>Most possession victims are female. The fox spirit enters the body either through the breast or under the fingernails. It resides on the left side of the body or in the stomach. The victim hears the fox spirit speak inside her head; when she talks out loud, the fox spirit takes on a different voice. The victim exhibits cravings for certain food, especially beans or rice demanded by the demon, sometimes as a condition of its departure. The victim also suffers insomnia, restlessness, and aberrant behavior.</p><p>The following case concerned a teenaged girl described as \"nervous from birth,\" who was recovering from typhus. Her weakened condition, plus strong belief in the kitsune, seemed to make her highly suggestible or vulnerable to possession:</p><p class=\"indent\"> A girl of seventeen years, irritable and capricious from childhood, was recovering from a very bad attack of typhus. Around her bed sat, or rather squatted in Japanese fashion, female relations chattering and smoking. Everyone was telling how in the dusk there had been seen near the house a form resembling a northern fox. It was suspicious. Hearing this, the sick girl felt a trembling in the body and was possessed. The fox had entered into her and spoke by her mouth several times a day. Soon he assumed a domineering tone, rebuking and tyrannizing over the poor girl.</p><p>After several weeks of this behavior, the family consulted an exorcist from the Nuhiren sect, specialists in dealing with <i>kitsune-tsuki</i>. The exorcist commenced a “solemn exorcism.” The fox resisted all efforts until food was provided:</p><p class=\"indent\"> Neither excommunication nor censing nor any other endeavor succeeded, the fox saying ironically that he was too clever to be taken in by such maneuvers. Nevertheless, he consented to come out freely from the starved body of the sick person if a plentiful feast was offered to him...On a certain day at four o’clock there were to be placed in a temple sacred to foxes and situated twelve kilometers away two vessels of rice prepared in a particular way, of cheese cooked with beans, together with a great quantity of roast mice and raw vegetables, all favorite dishes of magic foxes: then he would leave the body of the girl exactly at the prescribed time. And so it happened. Punctually at four o’clock when the food was placed in the distant temple the girl sighed profoundly and cried: “He has gone!” The possession was cured.</p><p> Not all cases of <i>kitsune-tsuki</i> are resolved. An account from the early 20th century tells of a 47-year-old Japanese woman who became permanently possessed. She was a peasant, sad-looking (and thus perhaps suffering from depression), not intelligent, but in good physical health. She sought out help in a university clinic in Tokyo. She related that one day eight years earlier, she had been with friends when one of them said that a fox had been driven out of a woman from a nearby village and was seeking a new home. This made quite an impression on her. The same evening, the door was opened unexpectedly at her home, and she felt a prick in the left side of her chest—the traditional entry point for a fox demon. She knew it was the fox, and immediately she became possessed: <p class=\"indent\">In the beginning the sinister guest contented himself with occasional stirrings in her bosom, and mounting into her head, criticized by her mouth her own thoughts and made mock of them. Little by little he grew bolder, mingled in all conversations, and abused those present.</p><p> The woman went to a succession of exorcists, including the hoiny, mendicant monks from the mountains who specialized in exorcism. None could help her.</p><p> The clinicians witnessed the appearance of the fox, who first showed with twitching of her mouth and arm on her left side where the demon had entered. These became more violent, and she repeatedly struck her left side with her fist. The fox spoke and called her a “stupid goose” and said he could not be stopped. There followed a fit in which the woman and the fox argued. It lasted about 10 minutes. The speech of the fox deteriorated, and then the spirit left her. The woman said that these fits occurred six to 10 times a day and even awakened her at night.</p><p>The clinicians put her in a glass room for round-theclock observation. The pattern was consistent. Any emotional excitation brought on a fit.</p><p>The fox spoke far more intelligently than the woman and even taunted the clinicians:</p><p class=\"indent\">“Look here, Professor. You might do something more intelligent than trying to entice me by your questions. Don’t you know that I am really a gay young girl, although I live in this old frump? You should rather pay court to me properly.”</p><p>The <i>kitsune</i> said he would depart with the proper offering of food but never did so. Efforts to cast him out with chloroform, verbal orders, and “other suggestion” (perhaps hypnotism) also failed. The woman was released without a cure, having been diagnosed as suffering from a chronic condition of “periodic delusion.”</p><p><p><i>Shape Shifting</i><br> To accomplish its shape shifting to human form, the kitsune flicks its fire-shooting tail once, puts on a human skull, turns around, and bows to the Big Dipper constellation. If the skull remains in place and does not fall, the transformation is successful.</p><p><b>Kitsune</b> hide in forested areas and use human voices to lure victims and cast spells over them. They also frequent eating and drinking establishments and prey upon people who eat and drink too much. If they eat and drink too much themselves, they vanish without harming the victim. In addition to sexually ravaging victims, the <i>kitsune</i> love to cut women’s hair and shave men’s heads as pranks.</p><p>According to lore, whenever it rains when the Sun is shining brightly, a kitsune bride is going through the woods in a procession to the home of her groom. Marsh lights are fireballs breathed by the foxes or created by their fire-shooting tails, or the lights are the torches carried by the foxes who lead a wedding procession.</p><p>In the mountainous areas of Japan where kitsune lore is strong, annual rites traditionally are held to ward off kitsune troubles. Processions of people take straw foxes and dolls to a mountain outside the village, where they are buried.</p>",

They do not bother good men, but they harass men of evil intent. The counterpart of the <i>larvae</i> are <i>lares</i>, benevolent ghosts of the dead who guard people, homes, and places.</p><p>Apuleius described both of these types of spirits in <i>De deo Socratis</i>:</p><p class=\"indent\">There is also another species of daemons, according to a second signifi cation, and this is a human soul, which, after its departure from the present life, does not enter into another body. I find that souls of this kind are called in the ancient Latin tongue Lemures. Of these Lemures, therefore, he who, being allotted the guardianship of his posterity, dwells in a house with an appeased and tranquil power, is called a Familiar [or domestic] Lar. But those are for the most part called <b>Larvae</b>, who, having no proper habitation, are punished with an uncertain wandering, as with a certain exile, on account of the evil deeds of their life, and become a vain terror to good, and are noxious to bad men.</p><p> Romans observed a festival in May called Lemuria, for appeasing the spirits of the dead, exorcising them from households, and preventing them from causing trouble. Businesses and temples closed. The most important ritual took place on the last night of the festival, when the larvae or lemures were exorcised. The homeowner or head of the household washed his hands three times, placed black beans in his mouth, and walked barefoot through the house, making the sign of the horns with his hands (see evil eye), tossing black beans over his shoulder, and saying, “With these beans I do redeem me and mine.” This incantation was repeated nine times without looking backward. The evil ghosts who followed would pick up the beans and depart, leaving the residents alone until the following year’s festival.</p><p> The Greeks had a similar festival, observed in February or March.</p><p> In <i>The City of God</i>, St. Augustine commented on <b>larvae</b>, believing them to be wicked demons, in reference to comments made by Plotinus: <p class=\"indent\">He [Plotinus] says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become Lares if they are good, Lemures or <b>Larvae</b> if they are bad, and Manes if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill. Who does not see at a glance that this is a mere whirlpool sucking men to moral destruction?</p><p class=\"indent\"> For, however wicked men have been, if they suppose they shall become <b>Larvae</b> or divine Manes, they will become the worse the more love they have for inflicting injury; for, as the <b>Larvae</b> are hurtful demons made out of wicked men, these men must suppose that after death they will be invoked with sacrifices and divine honors that they may infl ict injuries. But this question we must not pursue. He also states that the blessed are called in Greek eudaimones, because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.</p>",

      "description": "<p>A female demon of the night and Succubus who flies about searching for newborn children to kidnap or strangle and sleeping men to seduce in order to produce demon children. <b>Lilith</b> is a major  in Jewish demonology, appearing as early as 700 B.C.E. in the book of Isaiah; she or beings similar to her also are found in myths from other cultures around the world. She is the dark aspect of the Mother Goddess. She is the original <i>scarlet woman</i> and sometimes described as a screech owl, blind by day, who sucks the breasts or navels of young children or the dugs of goats.</p><p> In addition to Jewish folklore, <b>Lilith</b> appears in various forms in Iranian, Babylonian, Sumerian, Canaanite, Persian, Arabic, Teutonic, Mexican, Greek, English, Asian, and Native American legends. She is sometimes associated with other characters in legend and myth, including the queen of Sheba and Helen of Troy. In medieval Europe, she was often portrayed as the wife, concubine, or grandmother of Satan.</p><p> <b>Lilith</b> appears in different guises in various texts. She is best known as the first wife of Adam, created by God as twins joined in the back. <b>Lilith</b> demanded equality with Adam and, failing to get it, left him in anger. Adam complained to God that his wife had deserted him. God sent three angels, Sanvi, Sansanvi, and Semangelaf, to take <b>Lilith</b> back to Eden. The angels found her in the Red Sea and threatened her with the loss of 100 of her demon children every day unless she returned to Adam. She refused and was punished. <b>Lilith</b> took revenge by launching a reign of terror against women in childbirth, newborn infants—particularly males—and men who slept alone. She was forced, however, to swear to the three angels that whenever she saw their names or images on an amulet, she would leave infants and mothers alone.</p><p> After the Fall, Adam spent 130 years separated from Eve, during which <b>Lilith</b> went to him and satisfi ed him during sleep. They had a son, who became a frog.</p><p> The earliest account of <b>Lilith</b> appears in a midrash, <i>Alpha Bet Ben Sira</i>, which attempts to resolve the discrepancies in the Torah about the creation of <b>Lilith</b> in Genesis, followed by the creation of Eve just a few passages later. In the midrash, God created <b>Lilith</b> in the same way as he did Adam, but he used filth and impure sediment instead of dust from the earth. Adam and <b>Lilith</b> were at odds with each other from the beginning, and she refused to lie beneath him during intercourse. When she saw that Adam would gain power over her, she uttered the ineffable name of God and flew off to a cave in the desert near the Red Sea. There, as queen of Zemargad or queen of the desert, she engaged in promiscuity, including with demons, and gave birth to 100 demonic offspring called <i>lilim</i> every day. The daughters all practice SORCERY, seduction, and strangling.</p><p> She became the bride of Samael, the Devil (in some accounts called Ashmodai, or Asmodeus), in a union arranged by the Blind Dragon, an entity who has been castrated so that his offspring will not overcome the world. The <i>lilim</i> are hairy beings, having hair everywhere on their faces and bodies except their heads.</p><p> In a text preceding the Zohar, <b>Lilith</b> and Samael are born joined as androgynous twins from an emanation beneath the throne of glory. They are the lower aspects of another androgynous twin, Adam and Eve.</p><p> In the Zohar, <b>Lilith</b> arises from an evil shell or husk, a Kelippah, that is created in the waning of the Moon. In the beginning, the Sun and Moon were equal, and this created a rivalry. To end it, God diminished the Moon and made it rule the night. <b>Lilith's</b> powers are at their peak when the Moon is dark. She is the seducer of men and the strangler of children; the latter role is sometimes attributed to Naamah.</p><p> <b>Lilith</b>, who has the upper body of a beautiful woman and a lower body of fire, carries the  resentment of the Moon. <b>Lilith</b> lurks under doorways, in wells, and in latrines, waiting to seduce men. She is adorned with the “ornaments for seduction”:</p><p class=\"indent\"> Her hair is long and red like the rose, her cheeks are white and red, from her ears hang six ornaments, Egyptian cords and all the ornaments of the Land of the East hang from her nape. Her mouth is set like a narrow door comely in its decor, her tongue is sharp like a sword, her words are smooth like oil, her lips are red like a rose and sweetened by all the sweetness in the world. She is dressed in scarlet and adorned with forty ornaments less one.</p><p> Men who sleep alone are especially vulnerable to <b>Lilith</b>.<p> The Zohar also describes <b>Lilith</b> as a female aspect of Leviathan, who has a serpent body. She is Leviathan, the Tortuous serpent, the counterpart to the male aspect, Leviathon, the Slant serpent. <b>Lilith</b> is the serpent who tempts Eve with the apple of forbidden knowledge in paradise and thus instigates the Fall. She also persuades Eve to seduce Adam while she is menstruating and impure.</p><p> The numerical value of <b>Lilith's</b> name equals the Hebrew word for <i>screech</i>. Thus, <b>Lilith</b> is the <i>demon of screeching</i> and <i>the princess of screeching</i> and is personified as a screech owl. In legend, on the Day of Atonement, <b>Lilith</b> spends the day in a screeching battle with Mahalath, a concubine to Samael. They taunt each other so much that the very earth trembles. Also on the Day of Atonement, <b>Lilith</b> goes forth into the desert with 420 legions of her demons, and they march about while she screeches.</p><p> <b>Lilith</b> is also known as Lady of the Beasts, who rules the wilderness and all beasts, the animal side of human nature.</p><p> In her guise as the queen of Sheba, she attempted to seduce King Solomon. He discovered her true nature by having the djinn build a throne room with a floor of glass. <b>Lilith</b> mistook it for water and raised her garments in order to cross it to his throne. Her hairy, bestial legs were revealed in the reflection of the glass.</p><p> Amulets and Incantation Bowls traditionally protected new mothers and infants against <b>Lilith</b>. Common amulets were knives and hands inscribed with charms; some had bells attached. Frogs also protect against her. Male infants were vulnerable for the first week of life, girls for the first three weeks. Sometimes a magic circle was drawn around the lying-in bed, with a charm inscribed with the names of the three angels, Adam and Eve, and the words <i>barring Lilith or protect this newborn child from all harm</i>. Sometimes amulets with such inscriptions were placed in all corners of and throughout the bedchamber. If a child laughed in its sleep, it was a sign that <b>Lilith</b> was present. Tapping the child on the nose made the demon go away.</p><p> According to lore, men who had nocturnal emissions believed they had been seduced by <b>Lilith</b> during the night and had to say incantations to prevent the offspring from becoming demons. Any seed spilled during sex, even marital sex, is at risk for becoming <i>lilim</i>.</p>",

      "name": "Lucifer",
      "description": "<p>Fallen angel sometimes equated with Satan. In Latin, <b>Lucifer</b> means <i>light bringer</i>, and he originally was associated with Venus, the morning star. Lucifer’s identity as a prideful angel cast out of heaven with his followers—who became demons—rests mainly on legend and poetic literature, such as in the works of Dante and John Milton.</p><p> The sole biblical reference to <b>Lucifer</b> occurs in Isaiah 14:12: “How you are Fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!” The reference is probably to the boastful king of Babylon, a prediction of the fall of Babylon and its king. Jerome’s translation of the Bible, the Latin Vulgate, made <b>Lucifer</b> the chief Fallen angel. His rebellion against God with the sin of pride caused him and his followers to be cast from heaven. The Fallen angels lost their beauty and power and became demons.</p><p> 2 Enoch, also called the Slavonic Apocalypse of Enoch, names the leader of the Fallen as SatanAEL (Satanail). The text may date to the late first century, although some scholars believe it to be of medieval origin, because it exists only in Slavonic.</p><p> According to the text, God creates the ranks of angels on the second day of creation, shaping them out of a great fire cut off from rock. He gives them clothing of burning  and  weapons. He gives orders that each one should stand in his own rank. God tells the prophet Enoch:</p><p class=\"indent\"> But one from the order of the archangels deviated, together with the division that was under his authority. He thought up the impossible idea, that he might place his throne higher than the clouds which are above the earth, and thus he might become equal to my power.</p><p class=\"indent\"> And I hurled him out from the height, together with his angels. And he was ing around in the air, ceaselessly, above the Bottomless.</p><p> <b>Lucifer</b> has received most attention in Christianity. In the early years of Christianity, the name was sometimes applied to Christ as the light bearer. The early church father Origen, who lived in the second and third centuries, equated <b>Lucifer</b> and Satan; later, Augustine and Jerome were among those who followed suit. By the Middle Ages, both <i>Lucifer</i> and <i>Satan</i> were used as names for the Devil. <b>Lucifer</b> could apply to the Devil in either his prefall or postfall state. Milton’s Paradise Lost and Dante’s Inferno strengthened the connection of <b>Lucifer</b> to Satan.</p><p>In Mormonism, <b>Lucifer</b> (<i>Helel</i> in Hebrew) is a brilliant and powerful archangel, a son of Elohim (God the Father) and brother to Yahweh (God the Son, Jehovah, or Jesus) and to all of the children of Elohim including all of the souls of humanity. <b>Lucifer</b> became obsessed with pride and attempted to take over Elohim’s family and subvert the Father’s plan for his children. A struggle of wills ensued, and <b>Lucifer</b> and his followers lost. They are exiled to Earth and are permitted to tempt people. When Elohim’s purpose has been fulfilled, <b>Lucifer</b> and his demonis will be exiled to the “Outer Darkness,” completely cut off from divine light and love.</p><p> In the hierarchies of demons in magical lore, <b>Lucifer</b> is emperor of hell and ranks above Satan, one of his lieutenants. When conjured, he appears as a beautiful child. <b>Lucifer</b> rules Europeans and Asiatics.</p><p> In the 19th century, Leo Taxil, a Frenchman who excelled in occult hoaxes, perpetrated the fraud that Freemasonry was associated with worship of <b>Lucifer</b>. Although the hoax was thoroughly exposed, Taxil continues to be cited by opponents of Freemasonry.</p><p> Some modern occultists and Satanists see <b>Lucifer</b> as an archangel of light who will incarnate in human form at key times to confer enlightenment and redemption.</p>",

      "name": "Malleus Maleficarum (Witch Hammer)",
      "description": "<p>The most influential and important witch hunter’s guide of the Inquisition. Published first in Germany in 1487, the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> was translated into dozens of editions throughout Europe and England and was the leading reference for witch trials on the Continent for about 200 years. It was adopted by both Protestant and Catholic civil and ecclesiastical judges. It was second only to the Bible in sales until John Bunyan’s <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> was published in 1678. The book gives instructions for interrogating, trying, and punishing accused witches and details the nature, characteristics, and behavior of demons and the Devil.</p><p> Fourteen editions were published by 1520; another 16 editions appeared by 1669. By the end of the 17th century, there were more than 30 editions. The book became the definitive guide by which inquisitors and judges conducted themselves and that subsequent writers used as a foundation for their own works. The book was important in the way it linked witchcraft to heresy. It has been described in the centuries since as a vicious and cruel work, the most damaging book of its kind during the Inquisition.</p><p> <i>Authorship</i><br> The <b>Malleus Maleficarum</b> is credited to the authorship of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, though historians now believe that it was written by Kramer, by far the more zealous of the two and one of the most zealous participants in the entire Inquisition. Kramer and Sprenger were empowered by Pope Innocent VIII in his bull of December 9, 1484, to prosecute witches throughout northern Germany. The papal edict was intended to quell Protestant opposition to the Inquisition and to solidify the case made in 1258 by Pope Alexander IV for the prosecution of witches as heretics.</p><p> It was the opinion of the church that the secular arm, the civil courts, were not punishing enough witches solely on the basis of their evildoing.</p><p> Both Kramer and Sprenger were prolific writers. Kramer, also known as Institoris, the latinized version of his name, rose to power as an inquisitor and was known to have framed some of his victims. He was violently opposed to witchcraft and seemed also to harbor hatred against women, whom he viewed as inherently weak and evil. He sought to establish a direct connection between women and diabolic witchcraft. Some historians also think that Kramer was reacting to broader sentiments of the time that were responses to the  of holy women and mystics such as St. Catherine of Siena, a powerful  consulted by royalty and heads of state. He did praise the saintliness of certain holy women who were able to resist the lustful temptations indulged in by witches, in his view.</p><p> Sprenger was a distinguished friar, and he may have allowed Kramer to use his name in Kramer’s virulent antiwitch treatise, <i>Apologia auctoris</i> in Malleus Maleficarum, written by 1485. He had some association with Kramer in trials of accused witches.</p><p> Kramer’s treatise was absorbed into the <b>Malleus Maleficarum</b>. After its publication, evidence surfaced that Kramer <b>Malleus Maleficarum</b> may have fabricated one of the offi cial letters authorizing the work. Relations between Kramer and Sprenger became strained. After Sprenger died in 1496, his colleagues attempted to distance his legacy from Kramer.</p><p> Little is known about Kramer’s activities after publication of the Malleus in 1487 until his death in 1505. He remained an inquisitor. In 1500, Pope Alexander VI appointed him papal nuncio and inquisitor of Bohemia and Moravia. He was pursuing witches and heretics in Bohemia at the time of his death.</p><p><i>Contents</i><br>The Malleus is based on the biblical pronouncement “Thou shall not suffer a witch to live” (Exodus 22:18) and draws on Scripture and the works of Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas as support. It maintains that because God acknowledged witches, to doubt witchcraft is heresy. The book is divided into three parts and organized as questions answered by opposing arguments.</p><p> <b>Part 1</b> concerns how the Devil and his witches, with “the permission of Almighty God,” perpetrate a variety of evils upon men and animals, including succubi and incubi, instilling hatred, obstructing or destroying fertility, and causing the metamorphosis, or shape shifting, of human beings into beasts. God permits these acts; otherwise, the Devil would have unlimited power and destroy the world.</p><p> <b>Part 2</b> describes how witches cast spells and bewitchments and do their evil and how these actions can be prevented or remedied. Particular emphasis is given to Devil’s pacts, a key to proving heresy. The existence of witches and their <i>maleficia</i> is treated as unassailable fact, and wild stories of Sabbats and other abominations are presented as truth. Most of the stories are from the inquisitions conducted by Sprenger and Kramer and from material of other ecclesiastical witchcraft writers.</p><p> <b>Part 3</b> sets forth the legal procedures for trying witches, including the taking of testimony, admission of evidence, methods of interrogation and torture, and guidelines for sentencing. Judges are instructed to allow hostile witnesses because everyone hates witches. Torture is to be applied if the accused do not confess voluntarily. Judges are permitted to lie to the accused, promising them mercy if they confess, a tactic readily employed by Kramer. This, the text argues, is all done in the best interest of society and the state. The <i>Malleus</i> allows for light sentences of penance and imprisonment in certain cases but urges execution of as many witches as possible. Most of the instructions on sentencing pertain to death.</p><p> Some questions are not answered clearly and contradictions abound. For example, the authors say that the Devil, through witches, mainly affl icts good and just people, then says only the wicked are vulnerable. At one point, judges are said to be immune to the bewitchments of witches; at another, witches cast spells over judges with the glance of an eye, and judges are admonished to protect themselves with salt and sacraments.</p><p><b>The Malleus Maleficarum</b> was refuted by Johann Weyer.</p>",

The <b>Nephilim</b> sometimes are called the Sons of God, as are their angel parents. Helel is their chief. The <b>Nephilim</b> displeased God.</p><p> Genesis 6:4 implies that the <b>Nephilim</b> were already present upon the earth when the Sons of God began their relations with mortal women: “The <b>Nephilim</b> were upon the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the Sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.” The corruption brought by the mingling of angels and humans caused God to regret that he had created human beings on Earth. He decided to blot out not only the human race but every living thing on Earth. He selected Noah and his family to survive this disaster, the great flood, and repopulate the world.</p><p> Evidently not all the <b>Nephilim</b> perished, however, for a later reference in Numbers refers to the Anakim, the sons of the <b>Nephilim</b>: “And there we saw the <b>Nephilim</b> (the sons of Anak, who come from the <b>Nephilim</b>); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers and so we seemed to them” (13:33). The Anakim were later destroyed. 1 Enoch presents a more descriptive picture of the <b>Nephilim</b> as monstrous beings:</p><p class=\"indent\"> And the women became pregnant and gave birth to great giants whose heights were 300 cubits. These (giants) consumed the produce of all the people until the people detested feeding them. So the giants turned against the  (people) in order to eat them. And they began to sin against birds, wild beasts, reptiles and fish. And their flesh was devoured the one by the other, and they drank blood. And then the earth brought an accusation against the oppressors. (7:3–7)</p><p> Meanwhile, the Watchers spread more corruption by teaching people secret and magical arts they are not supposed to know. From the heavens above, the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Surafal observe in horror the bloodshed and oppression upon the earth. They hear the prayers of the people begging for help. They petition God to intervene, saying that the giants have filled Earth with blood and oppression. God declares that he will punish these transgressions with complete destruction in the flood. He tells Gabriel:</p><p class=\"indent\"> Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates and the children of adultery; and destroy the children of adultery and expel the children of the Watchers from among the people and send them against one another (so that) they may be destroyed in the fight, for length of days have they not. They will beg you everything—for their fathers on behalf of themselves because they hope to live an eternal life. (They hope) that each one of them will live a period of 500 years. (10:9–11)</p><p> The <b>Nephilim</b> also are the subject of a Qumran text referred to as the Enochic Book of Giants (4Q532). The text tells that two <b>Nephilim</b> sons of Semyaza (leader of the Watchers), named Ahya and Ohya, have a shared dream vision in which they visit a world garden and see 200 trees being cut down by angels. They do not understand the dream and so they take it to the <b>Nephilim</b> council. The council appoints one of their members, Mahawai, to consult Enoch in paradise and ask him what it means. Mahawai rises up into the air like the whirlwinds and flies with the help of his hands like an eagle until he reaches Enoch. Enoch says that the 200 trees symbolize the 200 Watchers who are going to be destroyed in the coming flood.</p><p> Later in the text, Mahawai transforms into a bird again to make another journey. He flies too close to the Sun and is threatened with incineration. He is saved by Enoch, whose voice descends from heaven to tell him to turn back and not die prematurely.</p>",

The boy grows thin. Solomon asks him why he is losing weight, and the boy tells him about <b>Ornias</b>. Incensed, Solomon begs God for help to have authority over the demon. The  archangel Michael gives him a magical ring with a seal engraved upon it that will bestow the power upon Solomon. Michael tells Solomon, “You shall imprison all the demons, male and female, and with their help you shall build Jerusalem when you bear this seal of God.”</p><p> Solomon gives the ring to the boy and instructs him to fling it at the demon’s chest when he next appears and 6rder him to go to Solomon.

      "description": "<p>The personification of evil and the head of all demons. He is equated with the Devil. <b>Satan</b> is a Hebrew word meaning <i>adversary</i> and originally was not a proper name. <b>Satan</b> has evolved over the centuries to become the opposite and the opponent of God, the Prince of Darkness, and the subverter of souls. His goal is turn to human beings away from God so that they become condemned to eternal torment in hell.</p><p> <b>Satan</b>, as the proper name of a being, makes scant appearance in religious texts prior to the New Testament. There is no mention of “the” <b>Satan</b>, or even “a” <b>Satan</b> in Genesis. The serpent who tempts Eve is not equated with <b>Satan</b>. The Old Testament features a variety of <b>Satan</b> adversaries, including an angel adversary in the story of Balaam and the ass in the book of Numbers; lying spirits; and, in the book of Job, a <b>Satan</b>, who is one of the Sons of God, and who walks the earth looking for people to test concerning their devotion to God. In the case of the pious and devout Job, God gives the <b>Satan</b> permission to test him, and he suffers years of setbacks, disasters, and losses. A <b>Satan</b>, as an accuser, is mentioned in the book of Zechariah. In 1 Chronicles, a <b>Satan</b> stands up and challenges David to take a census of the people. Psalm 109 refers to wicked men as Satans, and they should be punished by Yahweh.</p><p> In the New Testament, <b>Satan</b> becomes more personified as a particular, single entity, and the terms <b>Devil</b> and <b>Satan</b> are used interchangeably. The Gospels tell of <b>Satan's</b> testing Jesus in the wilderness. In Mark, he is named as <b>Satan</b>; in Matthew and Luke, he is <i>the tester</i> or <i>the Devil</i>. In Luke, the Devil promises Jesus earthly glory if he will pay the proper homage. In Luke 10, Jesus comments that he has seen <b>Satan</b> “Fallen like lightning from the sky,” a reference similar to the fall of Lucifer in Isaiah that is probably a prophecy of a fall to come, not one that occurred in the past. Luke also states that <b>Satan</b> entered into Judas to induce him to betray Jesus.</p><p> The Gospel of John makes references to the Devil. In the first, he is the “man-killer from the beginning” who does not stand for Truth, a reference often taken to refer to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. Jesus refers to him as the Ruler of the World. The Devil and <b>Satan</b> are both in reference to entering into the heart of Judas.</p><p> The Epistles refer to both the Devil and <b>Satan</b>. Paul refers to <b>Satan</b> by name as obstructing his efforts to spread the gospel, as a tester of men’s morals and faith, and as an agent of punishment for the wicked. In 2 Corinthians 2.10–11, Paul indicates that <b>Satan</b> has his own designs on the world, and that forgiveness will outwit <b>Satan</b>. In the same letter, Paul urges people to be on guard against <b>Satan</b>, who can disguise himself as an angel of light. He also says that an “angel of Satan” has been sent to batter him, to prevent him from becoming too puffed up with his own pride. Paul did not see <b>Satan</b> as marshaling an army of demons; rather, he said that demons were the lifeless idols of the pagans. In Ephesians, Paul gives advice for spiritual armaments against <b>Satan</b> and warns that committing sins will make room for him. In Hebrews, <b>Satan</b> has the power of death, and it is Christ’s mission to overcome him.</p><p> In Revelation, <b>Satan</b> is synonymous with the dragon and serpent. He tests people, battles angels, and is punished and bound.</p><p> The early church fathers did more to cement the identity of <b>Satan</b> with the Devil and the tempter in the Garden of Eden, and with Lucifer. In the second century, Justin Martyr was the first to identify <b>Satan</b> with the serpent. He said the fall of <b>Satan</b> at the hands of Christ was predicted in Isaiah in the description of the fall of Lucifer. Justin also linked <b>Satan</b> with the Sons of God, or Watchers, and associated the powers and principalities (two orders of angels) of the Epistles with pagan gods and demons.</p><p> Other church fathers, such as Theophilus and Tertullian, also placed <b>Satan</b> as tempter in the Garden. According to Cyprian, the Devil was once a beloved and intimate angel of God, who perished at the beginning of the world out of envy over humanity. In losing his own immortality, he took away the immortality of humans. Irenaeus echoed this view.</p><p> Origen (ca. 185–250) was the first church father to reinterpret <b>Satan</b> within the context of Lucifer.</p><p><i>The Life of Adam and Eve</i>, a pseudepigraphal text written around 100 A.D., states that the angel <b>Satan</b> was ordered by the archangel Michael to bow down and worship Adam, made in the image of God, but he refused because Adam was inferior, saying that Adam ought to worship him. The angels under <b>Satan</b> also refused, and God cast them all out of heaven. Muhammad was influenced by this text and retells the story in the Qur’an 10 times; the Devil is named Iblis, who is head of the djinn.</p><p> The idea that <b>Satan</b> was cast down because of his refusal to worship Adam did not take hold in Christianity, however. <b>Satan</b> is jealous of humans, but only after his fall.</p><p> <b>Satan</b> later became  with gods of paganism. The idea was developed that <b>Satan</b> had rights over humanity and the world because of the sin of Adam and Eve; redemption was made through Christ, who paid off the debt with his own life. According to St. Augustine, Adam’s sin meant that the whole of humanity fell under the servitude of <b>Satan</b>.</p><p>In the Middle Ages, legends and hagiographies of the saints were popular, offering many stories of saints besting the <b>Satan</b> and his demons and curing <i>demoniacs</i> of their <i>possession</i></p><p>  St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the greatest and most infuential theologians of the church, saw only one Devil, <b>Satan</b>, and never referred to <i>Devils</i> in the plural unless he was quoting other writers. Aquinas said that the only two sins angels can commit are pride and envy, for all other sins are related to physical appetites. According to Aquinas, demons have no possibility of redemption and can only go to hell (where they torment the dead) or Smoggy Air (where they torment the living). He said human beings deserved to be turned over to <b>Satan</b> because of Adam’s sin.</p><p> At some point—the origins are unclear—Satan became the ruler of hell and the chief tormenter of souls of the dead. From the 16th century on, his primary role was tempter of humanity.</p><p> The artist William Blake saw <b>Satan</b> as the imagination, a view also held in Sufism.</p><p> Even by the 18th century, <b>Satan</b> seemed an outdated superstition to some theologians, among them the infl uential Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768–1834), a minister in the Reformed Church. The concept of the Devil was unenlightened, he argued, pointing out that Jesus and the disciples made few direct references to <b>Satan</b>. Schleiermacher argued that <b>Satan</b> does not exist and is used as a convenient metaphor for evil.</p><p> Since the mid-20th century, belief in <b>Satan</b> has risen, in part the result of the rise of fundamentalism, and of interest in demonic possession.</p>",

      "name": "Solomon (10th century B.C.E)",
      "description": "<p>Legendary king of the Israelites, son of David, builder of the Temple of Jerusalem, and commander of an army of demons or djinn.</p><p> The actual existence of <b>Solomon</b> and his father, David, remains unproved, but they are among the most important figures of the Old Testament. <b>Solomon</b> is granted great wisdom and understanding by God, far surpassing the wisdom of any other man. He knows the lore of plants, animals, and everything in the natural world. Men from far away seek him out for his counsel. In legend, his wisdom expands to include formidable magical knowledge, and his name (including <i>Son of David</i>) is used to control both good and bad spirits.</p><p> In 1 Kings, <b>Solomon</b> takes the throne upon his father, David’s, death. The Lord goes to him in a dream and says, “Ask what I shall give you” (3:5). <b>Solomon</b> replies that he wishes to be given an understanding mind for governing and for discernment between good and evil. Pleased that he has not asked for riches, God says, “Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you” (3:12). God also grants him incomparable riches. Thus does <b>Solomon</b> become famed for his wisdom.</p><p> In the fourth year of his reign, <b>Solomon</b> builds his famed Temple of Jerusalem, and his palace and administrative complex. In the temple, he places two gilded olivewood cherubim in the innermost part of the sanctuary. He positions them so that a wing of one touches one wall and the wing of the other touches the other wall, and their other wings touch each other in the middle of the house. When the temple is dedicated, priests place the ark of the covenant, containing the two stone tablets of Moses upon which are written the Ten Commandments, underneath the wings of the cherubim.</p><p> <b>Solomon</b> has another vision, in which the Lord promises that his house will prosper as long as the commandments are kept and no other gods are worshipped. If there are any transgressions, God will cause the ruination to the kingdom.</p><p> For most of the 40 years of his reign, <b>Solomon</b> prospers: “Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of earth in riches and in wisdom. And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind” (10:23–24). He rules over the natural world as well as people.</p><p> By his later years, he has acquired 700 wives and 300 concubines. Some of his wives convince him to turn away from God and worship pagan deities, especially the goddess Ashtoreth. Angry, God sends adversaries against him. In the end, God decides not to wrest his kingdom away from <b>Solomon</b> but instead to take it away from all but one of his sons.</p><p> One day, <b>Solomon</b> went to a person described as “the Jebusite” and fell in love with his daughter, who is called the Shulamite (Soumanitis). The priests of Moloch, however, said, “Thou canst not have her to wife except thou worship the great gods Remphan and Moloch.” <b>Solomon</b> refused, but they gave him five locusts and said, “Crush these upon the altar of Moloch, and it will suffice.”</p><p> <b>Solomon</b> said, “And so I did, and immediately the Spirit of God departed from me...and I became a laughingstock unto the idols and to the demons. Therefore have I written this my Testament that ye which come on it may pray and take heed to your latter end and not to your beginning, that ye may find grace perfectly for ever.”</p><p> Other texts expand upon Solomon’s wisdom; he becomes the greatest of magicians, a ruler over the realm of nature, able to summon angels and command demons. Such details are found in the Testament of <b>Solomon</b>, Odes of <b>Solomon</b>, and Psalms of <b>Solomon</b>, all part of the pseudepigrapha, and in the Wisdom of <b>Solomon</b>, part of the apochrypha. Josephus’ <i>Antiquities</i> credits <b>Solomon</b> with writing 1,500 books of odes and songs and 3,000 books of parables and similitudes and knowing how to exorcize demons. The Sefer Raziel, a magical text, says that <b>Solomon</b> was heir to the famed book (also called the Book of Mysteries), which enabled him to become the source of all wisdom.</p><p> From the time of Origen, <b>Solomon</b> becomes more prominent in Christian lore than in Jewish lore, appearing on amulets, talismans, and lintels and in numerous incantations for protection against and removal of demons. His magical seal is a pentagram or hexagram.</p><p> In Islamic lore, <b>Solomon</b> becomes the greatest of world rulers, a true apostle and messenger of Allah, and the prototype of Muhammad. His magical powers against demons, the djinn, are famous. <b>Solomon</b> acquired his power over the djinn by asking for “soverignity not allowed to anyone after me” (sura 38:35). Allah responds by granting him unique power: “Then We subjected the wind to his power, to flow gently by his order wherever he wished, and also the evil Jinns, every builder and diver as well as those bound together in chains” (sura 38:36–38). <b>Solomon</b> alone was given the power to bind the djinn; however, much later, the prophet Muhammad repelled Iblis by invoking <b>Solomon's</b> prayer request for sovereignty (see exorcism).</p><p> According to tradition, after <b>Solomon</b> died, the djinn wrote books of magic filled with acts of disbelief, or disinformation, and put them under his chair. When the books were discovered, the djinn claimed that <b>Solomon</b> had used the magic in them to control the djinn. As a result, <b>Solomon</b> was discredited by some Christians and Jews. Others took the books and began practicing the magic. Both groups erred, according to scholars, one by practicing magic, which earns no happiness in the after life, and the other by discrediting <b>Solomon</b>, whose power was directly from Allah. The Qur’an says:</p><p class=\"indent\"> When a messenger from Allah came to them conforming what was revealed to them, a group of those given the scripture cast the book behind their backs as if they did not know about it. They followed what the Devils claimed about Sulaymaan’s dominion. However, Sulaymaan did not disbelieve, but the Devils did by teaching men magic and what was revealed to the two angels Haaroot and Maaroot in Babylon. Though neither of them taught anyone without first saying, “We are only a trial, so do not commit disbelief,” they learned from them means to separate a man from his wife. But, they could not harm anyone with it except by Allah’s will. They learned what would harm themselves and not what would benefi t them, though they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness in the next life. They sold their souls for an evil price if they only knew. (Sura 2:101–102)</p><p> Despite the warnings of Islam, the allure of Solomonic magic proved irresistible. Numerous magical handboorimoires, attributed to the authorship of <b>Solomon</b> were popular in the early centuries of Christianity. By the 12th century, at least 49 texts were in existence. The most famous was the Greater Key of <b>Solomon</b>, quoted often in the magical books of the 17th–19th centuries.</p><p><i>Testament of Solomon</i><br>The Testament of Solomon, a text in the pseudepigrapha probably written between the first and third centuries C.E., is a legendary tale about how Solomon built the Temple of Jerusalem by commanding demons. The text is rich in demonology, angelology, and lore about medicine, astrology, and magic. The author is unknown and may have been a Greek-speaking Christian who was Familiar with the Babylonian Talmud. The magical lore related to demons, which dominates the text, shows Babylonian influences.</p><p> The demons are described as Fallen Angels or the offspring of Fallen Angels and human women, and they live in stars and constellations. They can shape shift into beasts and forces of nature. They lurk in deserts and haunt tombs, and they dedicate themselves to leading people astray. They are ruled by Beelzeboul (Beelzebub), the Prince of demons.</p><p> The stellar bodies themselves are demonic, wielding destructive power over the affairs of humanity. The 36 decans, or 10-degree portions of the zodiac, are called heavenly bodies and likewise are ruled by demons, who cause mental and physical illnesses. There are seven “world rulers,” who are equated with the vices of deception, strife, fate, distress, error, power, and “the worst,” each of whom is thwarted by a particular angel (with the exception of “the worst”).</p><p> The testament considers angels as God’s messengers but does not describe their origin or hierarchy. The main purpose of angels is to thwart demons and render them powerless. Each angel is responsible for thwarting specific demons. Humans must call upon the right angel by name in order to defeat a demon; otherwise, demons are worshipped as gods. Among the angels named are the archangels Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel.</p><p> When the demon ornias vampirizes <b>Solomon's</b> favorite boy by sucking out his soul through his thumb, <b>Solomon</b> begs God for power over the demon. While he prays, Michael appears and gives <b>Solomon</b> a ring with a seal engraved upon a precious stone. Michael tells <b>Solomon</b> that this magical ring will give him power over all demons, male and female, and that they will help him build the temple. The demons are subdued when the ring is thrown at their chests with the command “Solomon summons you!” <b>Solomon</b> interviews the demons and demands from them the names of their thwarting angels. When they are subdued, they are made to construct his temple.</p><p> One of demons interrogated by <b>Solomon</b> gives no name but describes himself as “a lecherous spirit of a giant man who died in a massacre in the age of giants.” He lives in “inaccessible places.” When someone dies, he sits in the tomb near the body and assumes the form of the dead man. If anyone visits, he tries to seize him or her, and, if he can, he kills that person. If he cannot kill the person, the demon causes him or her to become possessed by a demon and to gnaw his or her own flesh and drool at the mouth. The demon admits to <b>Solomon</b> that he is thwarted by the Savior, and if anyone bears the cross, the mark of the Savior, on his forehead, the demon flees. <b>Solomon</b> binds the demon and locks him up as he has the others.</p><p> The Testament of <b>Solomon</b> also describes the demons of the decans of the zodiac, the 36 degrees dividing the 12 zodiacal signs. The decans are ruled by angels, but in the Testament, they are reduced to lower-level demons who cause disease and strife.</p><p> <b>Solomon</b> summons them to appear before him for interrogation to learn what they do and the names of the angels who thwart them. They appear with heads of formless dogs and as humans, bulls, dragons with bird faces, beasts, and sphinxes. The demons are, by order of decan:</p><p> 1st—Ruax (also Rhyx), or “the Lord”: He causes headaches and is dispatched by the words “Michael, imprison Ruax.”<br> 2nd—Barsafael: He causes those who live in his period to have pains in the sides of their heads. He is repelled by the words “Gabriel, imprison Barsafael.”<br> 3rd—Artosael: He damages eyes and is sent away by the words “Uriel, imprison Artosael.” <br>4th—Oropel: He causes sore throats and mucus and is thwarted by the words “Raphael, imprison Oropel.” <br>5th—Kairoxanondalon: He causes ear problems and is dispatched by the words “Ourouel (Uriel), imprison Kairoxanondalon.” <br>6th—Sphendonael: He causes tumors of the parotid gland and tetanic recurvation (the body bent backward rigidly) and is quelled by the words “Sabael, imprison Sphendonael.” <br>7th—Sphandor: He paralyzes limbs, deadens the nerves in hands, and weakens shoulders. He is subdued by the words “Arael, imprison Sphandor.” <br>8th—Belbel: He perverts the hearts and minds of men and is dispatched by the words “Karael, imprison Belbel.” <br>9th—Kourtael: He causes bowel colic and pain and retreats when he hears the words “Iaoth, imprison Kourtael.” <br>10th—Methathiax: He causes kidney pains and is sent away by the words “Adonael, imprison Methatiax.”<br>11th—Katanikotael: He causes domestic fights and unhappiness. To dispel him, write on seven laurel leaves the names of the angels who thwart him: “angel, Eae, Ieo, Sabaoth.” <br>12th—Saphthorael: He causes mental confusion. To get rid of him, write down the words “Iae, Ieo, sons of Sabaoth” and wear the amulet around the neck. <br>13th—Phobothel: He causes loosening of the tendons and retreats when he hears the word “Adonai.” <br>14th—Leroel: He causes fever, chills, shivering, and sore throats and retreats when he hears the words “Iax, do not stand fast, do not be fervent, because Solomon is fairer than eleven fathers.” <br>15th—Soubelti: He causes shivering and numbness and is dispatched by the words “Rizoel, imprison Soubelt.” <br>16th—Katrax: He causes fatal fevers. He can be averted by rubbing pulverized coriander on the lips and saying, “I adjure you by Zeus, retreat from the image of God.” <br>17th—Ieropa: He causes men to collapse and creates stomach problems that cause convulsions in the bath. He retreats if the words “Iouda Zizabou” are repeated three times in the right ear of the afflicted person. <br>18th—Modebel: He causes married couples to separate but will retreat if the names of the eight fathers are written down and posted in doorways. <br>19th—Mardeo: He causes incurable fevers and is sent away by writing his name down in the house. <br>20th—Rhyx Nathotho: He causes knee problems and is repelled if the word “Phounebiel” is written on a piece of papyrus. <br>21st—Rhyx Alath: He causes croup in infants and is dispelled if the word “Rarideris” is written down and carried on a person. <br>22nd—Rhyx Audameoth: He causes heart pain and is dispatched by the written word “Raiouoth.” <br>23rd—Rhyx Manthado: He causes kidney disease and is thwarted by the written words “Iaoth, Uriel.” <br>24th—Rhyx Atonkme: He causes rib pain. If a person writes “Marmaraoth of mist” on a piece of wood from a ship that has run aground, the demon retreats. <br>25th—Rhyx Anatreth: He causes bowel distress and is quelled by the words “Arara, Arare.” <br>26th—Rhyx, the Enautha: He alters hearts and “makes off” with minds. He is thwarted by the written word “Kalazael.” <br>27th—Rhyx Axesbuth: He causes diarrhea and hemorrhoids. If he is adjured in pure wine given to the sufferer, he retreats. <br>28th—Rhyx Hapax: He causes insomnia and is subdued by the written words “Kok; Phedisomos.” <br>29th—Rhyx Anoster: He causes hysteria and bladder pain and is thwarted when someone mashes laurel seeds into oil, massages it into the body, and calls upon Mamaroth. <br>30th—Rhyx Physikoreth: He causes long-terms illnesses but retreats when the sick person massages his or her body with salted olive oil while saying, “Cherubim, seraphim, help me.” <br>31st—Rhyx Aleureth: He causes choking on fish bones. If one places a fish bone into the breasts of the afflicted one, the demon retreats. <br>32nd—Rhyx Ichthuron: He detaches tendons and retreats when he hears the words “Adaonai, malthe.” <br>33rd—Rhyx Achoneoth: He causes sore throats and tonsillitis. He is sent away by writing “Leikourgos” on ivy leaves and heaping them into a pile. <br>34th—Rhyx Autoth: He causes jealousy and fights between people who love each other. He is subdued by writing the letters alpha and beta. <br>35th—Rhyx Phtheneoth: He cast the evil eye on everyone and is thwarted by the “much suffering eye” amulet. <br>36th—Rhyx Mianeth: He holds grudges against the body, causes flesh to rot, and demolishes houses. He flees when the words “Melto Ardad Anaath” are written on the front of the house.</p><p> <b>King Solomon</b> orders the demons of the decans to bear water and prays that they will go to the Temple of God (Jerusalem).</p><p> <i>Magical Handbooks</i><br>The <i>Testament</i> provides a contribution to the legends of Solomon’s magical powers and the magical handbooks attributed to <b>Solomon</b>.

      "name": "Succubus",
      "description": "<p>A demon who takes the form of a beautiful woman in order to seduce men.</p><p> The <b>Succubus</b>, along with its male counterpart, the Incubus, appears in ancient mythologies. Succubi appear in the flesh as beautiful, voluptuous women. They visit men in their sleep—especially men who sleep alone—and cause erotic dreams, nightmares, and nocturnal emissions. During the European witch hunts, succubi were agents of the Devil, who continually tempted men to commit sexual sins, sometimes by promising them immortality in return.</p><p> Succubi were not as prevalent as incubi in witch hunt cases. The prevailing belief of the time was that women were more licentious than men and, therefore, offered more opportunity for incubi. If a <b>Succubus</b> assaulted a man, it was probably not his fault, according to demonologists of the day.</p><p> Nicholas Remy wrote in <i>demonolatry</i> of a <b>Succubus</b> case that happened in 1581. A man named Petrone Armenterious of Dalheim was persuaded by a <b>Succubus</b>, Abrahel, to murder his son. He was so overcome with grief and guilt that he contemplated suicide. Abrahel told him that if he worshipped her, he would restore the boy to life. He complied, and his son returned to the living. But it was all an illusion, for the boy suddenly died again and immediately stank abominably.</p><p> The sex act itself with a <b>Succubus</b> was said to be an awful experience, like penetrating a cavern of ice. Sometimes, a <b>Succubus</b> was really an Incubus in disguise, who collected a man’s semen and used it to impregnate a woman. Some believed that sex with succubi could produce demon children. The Hebrew night demon, Lilith, bore an infinite number of demon sons this way.</p><p> Men accused of witchcraft were tortured until they confessed having sex with demons, among other demonic crimes. In 1468, in Bologna, Italy, a man was executed for allegedly running a brothel of succubi.</p><p> <i>The Malleus Maleficarium</i> (1487), the chief inquisitors’ handbook, set forth five ways to get rid of a <b>Succubus</b>:</p><p> <li>by reciting the Ave Maria</li><li> by making a sacramental confession</li><li>by making the sign of the cross</li><li>by moving to a new home</li><li>by having a priest or holy man excommunicate the demon</li></p><p> The Lord’s Prayer and holy water also were said to work a cure.</p><p> Francesco-Maria Guazzo wrote of one alleged <b>Succubus</b> incident in <i>Compendium Maleficarum</i> (1608), in which a <b>Succubus</b> forced herself on a young man near Aberdeen, Scotland. The <b>Succubus</b> visited him in bed every night and stayed until dawn. The young man claimed that he tried to get rid of the <b>Succubus</b>, but to no avail. Finally, the local bishop ordered him to go away to another place and devote himself to prayer and fasting. After several days, the young man said the <b>Succubus</b> left him.</p><p> At the end of the 17th century, an odd lawsuit was tried in court in Posen, Germany. A young man forced his way into the cellar of a locked home and was later found dead on the threshold. demons then set up housekeeping inside and created severe disturbances. The owners of the home were frightened into leaving.</p><p> Local exorcists failed to expel the demons, and so an expert was summoned, Rabbi Joel Baal Shem of Zamosz. He was able to induce the demons to disclose their identity. They claimed the house belonged to them, and they demanded the opportunity to prove it in a court of law. The case was tried with Rabbi Joel and an invisible demon advocate, who could be heard.</p><p> According to the demons, the previous owner of the home had engaged in intercourse with a <b>Succubus</b>, who had borne hybrid children. The man was persuaded by a rabbi to break off his affair, but the demon demanded that the cellar be given to it and the offspring as inheritance. The man and all his heirs were now dead, and the demon children demanded possession of the house.</p><p> The new homeowners said they had lawfully purchased the house. The demon children were not legitimate “seed of men” and so had no legal rights. In addition, the demon had forced the previous owner into sexual relations. </p><p>The court decided against the demons, saying that their abodes were deserts and wastelands, not the homes of men. Rabbi Joel performed exorcisms that drove away the demons.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Fallen Angels. The <b>Watchers</b> cohabited with human women and fell from God’s grace. <b>Watchers</b> are also referred to as Sons of God. Their monstrous offspring, the Nephilim, and the corruption the <b>Watchers</b> created on Earth so revolted God that he decided to send the great flood to destroy all life on Earth. The cohabitation of the Sons of God and the daughters of men is brie described in Genesis 6:1–4.</p><p> <b>Watchers</b> also describes angels who do not fall but who are close to the throne of God, thus causing some confusion as to whether they are good or bad.</p><p> 1 Enoch tells in detail the story of the <b>Watchers</b> and their fall. The <b>Watchers</b>, described as angels who are <i>the children of heaven</i>, see the beautiful daughters of men and desire them. They decide to take them as wives. But their leader, Semyaza, expresses the fear that he alone will be held accountable for this great sin. The angels, who are 200 in number, swear an oath binding them all together. Their chiefs (called chiefs of tens) who serve under Semyaza are Arakeb, Rameel, Tamel, Ramel, Danel, Ezeqel, Baraqyal, Asel, Armaros, Batrel, Ananel, Zaqeel,Sasomaspweel, Kestarel, Turel, Yamayol, and Arazyal.</p><p> The <b>Watchers</b> descend to Earth and take the women. Many of them commit adultery against their new wives. Their offspring, the giant Nephilim, turn against people, cannibalize them, and drink their blood.</p><p> The <b>Watchers</b> teach people secret arts such as magical medicine, incantations, and knowledge of plants and herbs. Azazel teaches the art of making weapons of war, jewelry, and cosmetics, and dye making and alchemy. Amasras teaches plant lore and how to perform magic. Baraqiyal teaches astrology, Kokarerel teaches the zodiac, Tamel teaches about the stars, and Asderel teaches about the Moon and the deception of humans.</p><p> Later in the text, 1 Enoch gives the names of 21 chiefs of the Fallen (some angels are named more than once):</p><div class=\"double-row\"><div>Semyaza</div><div>Aristaqis</div><div>Armen</div><div>Kokbael</div><div>Turel</div><div>Rumyal</div><div>Danyul</div><div>Neqael</div><div>Baraqel</div><div>Azazel</div><div>Armaros</div><div>Betryal</div><div>Besasel</div><div>Hananel</div><div>Turel</div><div>Sipwesel</div><div>Yeterel</div><div>Tumael</div><div>Turel</div><div>Rumel</div><div>Azazel</div></div><p>Fallen angels who are known as the Five Satans:</p><li>Yeqon, who misleads all the children of the angels, brings them down upon the earth, and perverts them by the daughters of the people</li><li>Asbel, who misleads holy angels so that they will defi le their bodies by the daughters of the people</li><li>Gaderel, who shows the children of the people all the blows of death, who misleads Eve, and who shows the children of the people how to make weapons and all other instruments of war and death</li><li>Pinene, who demonstrates to people the bitter and the sweet, reveals to them all the secrets of wisdom, and teaches them the secret of writing with ink and paper, thus causing them to err through all eternity</li><li>Kasadya, “who reveals the flagellations of all evil including the flagellation of the souls and the demons, the smashing of the embryo in the womb so that it may be crushed, and the of the soul; snake bites, sun strokes, and the son of the serpent whose name is Tabata” according to 1 Enoch 69:4–12</li></p><p> Sin, corruption, and oppression spread across the earth. Horrified, the angels Michael, Surafel (Suriel/Uriel), and Gabriel petition God to take action, for the people on Earth are suffering. God declares that he will wipe out the wicked and all life on Earth in a great . He instructs Raphael to bind Azazel hand and foot and to throw him into darkness. Raphael makes a hole in the desert, casts Azazel into it, and covers him with sharp rocks. God tells Gabriel to destroy the children of the Watchers. He tells Michael to inform Semyaza that they will die together with their wives and children in their defi lement. He is to bind them for 70 generations beneath rocks until the day of judgment. They will then be led into the bottom of, where they will be locked up in prison and in torment forever. All those who collaborated with  the Watchers will be similarly punished. Finally, Michael is to eradicate injustice from the face of the Earth.</p><p> The Watchers call to the prophet Enoch for help, and he hears them in a dream vision. Upon awakening, he tells Azazel there will be no peace for him, for a grave judgment has come upon him. Enoch then speaks to all the Watchers, who are full of fear and trembling. They beg him to write a prayer of forgiveness for them. Enoch records their prayers and petitions and then reads them until he falls asleep. He has another dream vision in which he sees plagues. When he awakens, he goes to the Watchers and reprimands them for their sins and tells them their petitions will not be heard.</p><p> Enoch nonetheless tries to intercede on behalf of the Watchers but is refused by God. God says that their giant offspring shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, for they will dwell on the earth and in the earth. He tells Enoch to inform the Watchers that because they have rejected heaven, they shall have no peace.</p><p> 1 Enoch also gives the names of </i>the holy angels who watch</i>, implying that the term Watchers was given to angels in heaven, not just the Fallen ones. The holy angels are<li>Suruel—angel of eternity and trembling</li><li>Raphael—angel of the spirits of man</li><li>Raguel—angel who takes vengeance for the world and for the luminaries</li><li>Michael—angel who is obedient in his benevolence over the people and the nations</li><li>Saraqael—angel who is over the spirits of mankind and who is in the spirit</li><li>Gabriel—angel who oversees the garden of Eden, the serpents, and the cherubim</li><p> In 2 Enoch, Enoch sees the <i>innumerable armies</i> of the Watchers and Nephilim imprisoned in the fifth heaven. They are dejected and silent. Enoch, who unsuccessfully tries to intercede on their behalf with God, urges them to sing a liturgy to God so that God will not be enraged against them “to the limit.” They do so, singing in a piteous and touching way.</p><p> 3 Enoch describes the Watchers as holy angels. According to the text, four great princes called “Watchers and holy ones” (the terms used in Daniel) reside in the seventh heaven opposite the throne of glory facing God. They are called Watchers and holy ones because on the third day of judgment (after death), they sanctify the body and soul with lashes of  (a reference to preparing the soul for God’s presence).</p><p> Each Watcher has 70 names corresponding to the 70 languages of the world, and all of them are based on the name of God. Each name is written with a pen of flame on God’s crown. Such sparks and lightning shoot forth from them that no angels, not even the seraphim, can look upon them.</p><p> The Watchers are praised with the praise of the Shekinah, and God does nothing without taking their counsel. They function as offi cers in the heavenly court and debate and close each case that comes up for judgment. They announce the verdicts, proclaim the sentences, and sometimes go down to Earth to carry out the sentences.</p><p> A Qumran text called the Testament of Amran (Q543, 545–548), which exists only in several fragments and manuscripts, concerns the Watchers. In Manuscript B Fragment 1, the anonymous author describes a dream vision in which two Watchers are fighting over him. He asks, “Who are you that you are thus empowered over me?” They tell him that they have been empowered to rule over all humankind, and they ask him to choose which of them he would want as a ruler. One of them has a terrifying appearance, like a serpent wearing a dark cloak of many colors. He has a “visage like a viper.”</p><p> Fragment 2 identifies Belial as one of the Watchers.  He has three titles, <i>Belial</i>, <i>Prince of Darkness</i>, and <i>King of Evil</i>, and he is empowered over all darkness and his every way, and every work are darkness. Fragment 3 mentions the “sons of Light,” who are ruled by a being who identifies himself with three names: <i>Michael</i>, <i>Prince of Light</i>, and <i>King of Righteousness</i>.</p><p> Another fragment says that all the sons of Darkness will be destroyed because of their foolishness and evil and the sons of Light will have eternal joy  and rejoicing for all peace and truth will be made light.</p>",

      "name": "Zar",
      "description": "<p>In Muslim lore, a possessing djinn that usually attacks women and refuses to leave until the victim receives lavish gifts of jewelry, perfume, clothes, and dainty foods.</p><p> Second-class citizens under male domination, Muslim women rely on the zar to give them some measure of power and privilege. Husbands must provide expensive gifts and sweetmeats to create peace in the household. Such appeasement raises suspicions of manipulation, but so ingrained in Islamic culture is the belief in spirit interference that husbands dare not tempt fate. Descriptions of zar possession were recorded in the early 19th century by travelers to the Egypt and the Middle East. The “cult of the <i>zar</i>” continues in areas in modern times.</p><p> The usual possession and exorcism of the zar proceed as follows: The victim, suffering from some minor complaint, blames possession by the zar, and other female relatives prevent her from seeing a medical doctor, preferring the services of an old woman who is a female shaman, a <i>shechah-ez-zar</i>. For a fee, the <i>shechah</i> a zar as the source of the woman’s troubles and interrogates the zar, sometimes in a recognizable language and sometimes in zar language, understood only by the shechah. After repeated conversations, the zar offers to leave once the possessed victim receives specifi c lavish gifts and attention from her husband.</p><p> On the afternoon of the zar’s scheduled departure, a “beating the <i>zar</i>” ceremony is performed at the victim’s home. The victim’s female friends and relatives join her for the ceremony, often accompanied by food, coffee, and a flute and drumming performance. The <i>shechah</i> and her assistants chant the final exorcism rites, with music, and then often  a lamb. The lamb’s blood is rubbed on the victim’s forehead and elsewhere. She then dances madly, sways, and finally faints. The <i>zar</i> leaves, satisfied that the victim has been rewarded.</p><p> In some ceremonies, the questioning of the zar is done after the victim and others dance and enter trance. The shechah asks for a remedy to the malady, and the zar specifi es gifts. The ecstatic dancers may be shown silver rings and bracelets and other objects, which pacify the zar. On a day fixed by the zar, another fi t can occur, which can be relieved only by the satisfying of a wish.</p><p> <b>Zar</b> exorcisms have become part of contemporary urban Islamic culture. In many large cities, such as Cairo, regular exorcisms are held in a public building as often as once a week. The length of the ceremony, from three to seven nights, depends upon the fee that can be paid.</p><p> Women from all walks of life participate, whirling and dancing until the spirit leaves them and they return home, exhausted but entertained. Relief from the possession may be only temporary, and it may return with another infraction committed by a husband. Men are expected to believe in the possession  which, in addition to giving women the freedom to ask for gifts, permits them to scold and upbraid their husbands in a manner that would be forbidden under normal circumstances.</p><p> Nineteenth-century accounts of <i>zar</i> possession in Abyssinia describe a different cult that affected men as well as women, blamed on the <i>zar</i>, or <i>bouddha</i>, evil spirit. The victim typically was afflicted in the middle of the night. He would run out, roll on the ground, and scream until exhausted and still. The remedy consisted of taking a hen, swinging it around the head, and smashing it to the ground. If the hen died immediately, it meant the zar had passed into the body of the fowl and the victim was cleared. If the hen survived, the remedy had to be repeated until a bird died.</p>",
